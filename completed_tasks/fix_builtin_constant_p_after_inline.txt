Task: Fix ARM kernel link failures from dead code not eliminated (COMPLETED)

Two fixes applied:

Fix 1: __builtin_constant_p deferred evaluation
- Added IsConstant variant to IrUnaryOp
- Lower __builtin_constant_p to UnaryOp { op: IsConstant } instead of
  immediately resolving to constant 0
- constant_fold resolves IsConstant to 1 if operand is constant
- Codegen emits 0 for any remaining unresolved IsConstant

Fix 2: cfg_simplify resolves CondBranch/Switch through Copy/Phi instructions
- fold_constant_cond_branches and fold_constant_switches now look through
  Copy and Phi instructions in the same block to resolve Value operands
  to constants, without waiting for a separate copy_prop pass
- This fixes the kernel pattern where simplify_trivial_phis creates
  Copy { dest: V, src: Const(0) } but the CondBranch { cond: V } was not
  folded until copy_prop ran in a later pipeline phase
- Critical for kernel's system_supports_sve()/system_supports_sme() guards
