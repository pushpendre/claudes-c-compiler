Task: Fix ARM kernel build failures from parsing_const leak and static const ternary init (IN PROGRESS)

Two fixes applied:

Fix 1: Ternary/conditional expressions in static const initializers
- Added Expr::Conditional arm to eval_global_addr_expr in const_eval_global_addr.rs
- Added eval_addr_comparison_cond helper to evaluate fn == NULL / fn != NULL comparisons
- Handles the Linux kernel _OF_DECLARE macro pattern:
  .data = (fn == (fn_type)NULL) ? fn : fn
- Previously these evaluated to NULL, causing NULL function pointers in __clk_of_table

Fix 2: parsing_const leak from struct fields and cast expressions
- Saved/restored parsing_const around parse_struct_fields() in types.rs
- Saved/restored parsing_const around cast/compound literal parsing in expressions.rs
- Previously, const from field types (e.g., const char *name) leaked to outer
  declaration, incorrectly marking non-const variables as const
- This caused .init.data section to get read-only "a" flags instead of "aw",
  leading to assembly errors "changed section attributes for .init.data"
- Affected 4 kernel files: arch/arm64/xen/enlighten.o, drivers/clk/rockchip/clk-px30.o,
  clk-rk3328.o, clk-rk3308.o
