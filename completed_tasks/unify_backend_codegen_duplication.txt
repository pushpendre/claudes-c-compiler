Unify duplicated code patterns across x86/ARM/RISC-V backend codegen files

The three backend codegen files (x86: 3862 lines, ARM: 3678 lines, RISC-V: 3909 lines)
contain significant code duplication. This task extracts shared patterns into the
trait system or shared helper functions.

Patterns unified in this task:
- Switch jump table construction (build_jump_table + emit_jump_table_rodata)
- Copy value logic (register-aware emit_copy_value default with 3-way dispatch)
- Call result store logic (emit_call_store_result default with 4 arch primitives)

Remaining patterns not yet addressed:
- Value resolution (alloca/register/stack slot dispatch) - ~53 occurrences
- Callee-save register save/restore loops in prologue/epilogue
- Cast instruction dispatch (emit_cast_instrs structure)

Net effect: ARM backend shrinks ~70 lines. Shared infrastructure adds ~100 lines
to traits.rs. The value is in reducing semantic duplication (identical algorithms
expressed 3 times) rather than raw line count reduction.

Status: complete
