Add doomgeneric (DOOM) as a verified project in the test/verification suite.

This verifies that ccc-x86 can compile and statically link the doomgeneric
DOOM port (ANSI terminal renderer), producing a working static binary.

The doomgeneric project is a good test because:
- It's a real-world C codebase (~70 source files)
- Uses -lm (math library linkage)
- Static linking (-static flag)
- Standard C with POSIX extensions
- Already verified to work: kernel + DOOM boots in QEMU
