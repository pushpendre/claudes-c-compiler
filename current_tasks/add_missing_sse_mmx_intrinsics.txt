Add missing SSE intrinsics that operate on __m64 (MMX) types to xmmintrin.h.
These include _mm_movemask_pi8, _mm_mulhi_pu16, _mm_shuffle_pi16, and many others.
Needed by cairo, pixman, and other graphics libraries.
Also add other commonly missing SSE intrinsics like scalar min/max,
comieq/ucomieq comparisons, conversions, and more.
