Adding missing SSE/SSE2 instruction encodings to the x86 native assembler.

Key instructions to add:
1. movq with XMM registers (GP<->XMM 64-bit, mem<->XMM 64-bit)
2. pcmpeqb, pcmpeqd - packed byte/dword compare equal
3. pand, por, pxor - packed bitwise operations
4. psubusb, psubsb - packed unsigned/signed byte subtract
5. crc32b/w/l/q - CRC32 intrinsic instructions

These are all emitted by the codegen but not yet handled by the encoder,
causing assembler failures when MY_ASM=builtin is set.
