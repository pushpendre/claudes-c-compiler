Adding missing x86 I/O port instructions to the assembler for kernel build support.

Instructions to add:
- outsl/insl as aliases for outsd/insd (AT&T long suffix)
- outb/outw/outl: OUT al/ax/eax, dx (port I/O with register operands)
- inb/inw/inl: IN dx, al/ax/eax (port I/O with register operands)
- Also: outb/inb with immediate port number

These are needed for the x86 tinyconfig kernel build (lib/iomap.o, drivers/tty/serial/8250).
