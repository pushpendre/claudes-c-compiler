Task: Add missing NEON/SIMD instruction encoding to ARM assembler

The ARM assembler encoder is missing many NEON instructions that are needed
for inline assembly tests. Adding these will fix ~40+ test failures.

Instructions to add:
- ld1, st1 (vector load/store)
- movi (move immediate to vector)
- tbl (table lookup)
- bic (bitwise clear vector)
- bsl (bitwise select)
- rev64 (reverse elements in doubleword)
- eor3 (three-way XOR, SHA3)
- not (vector NOT)
- shl (shift left immediate)
- sshr (signed shift right immediate)
- ins (insert element)
- uzp1/uzp2 (unzip)
- sli (shift left and insert)
- bics (vector bitwise clear)
- pmull (polynomial multiply long)
- aesd, aese, aesmc, aesimc (AES crypto)
