Task: ARM Kernel Boot Testing with ccc-arm
Status: in_progress

Goal: Get Linux 6.9 kernel building and booting on ARM64 (aarch64) using ccc-arm,
following the same pattern as the existing RISC-V kernel boot process.

Steps:
1. Build compiler
2. Verify GCC ARM baseline kernel build + QEMU boot works
3. Test ccc-arm kernel build, identify first error
4. Fix the first issue found
5. Document the process
