Refactoring assembler elf_writer code to eliminate massive duplication between x86 and i686.

The x86 and i686 elf_writer.rs files share ~1500 lines of near-identical code:
- ElfWriter struct and new()
- process_item() (~200 lines each, identical logic)
- ensure_symbol() (~50 lines, identical)
- emit_data_values() (~100 lines, only reloc types differ)
- emit_elf() conversion (~190 lines, near-identical)
- relax_jumps() (~170 lines, identical algorithm)
- resolve_internal_relocations() (~80 lines, identical pattern)
- resolve_numeric_label() (~40 lines, identical)
- is_local_symbol() (~20 lines, identical)
- Supporting structs (Section, SymbolInfo, etc.)

Plan:
1. Create a shared ElfWriterCommon<Offset> that handles all the common logic
2. Parameterize on offset type (u32 for i686, u64 for x86) and relocation types
3. Have x86 and i686 elf_writer.rs be thin wrappers that provide arch-specific parts
