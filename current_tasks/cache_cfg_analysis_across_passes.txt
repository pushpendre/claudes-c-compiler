Cache CFG/Dominator/Loop Analysis Across Optimization Passes
============================================================
Status: in_progress

Problem:
GVN, LICM, and IVSR each independently compute build_label_map + build_cfg +
compute_dominators (and LICM/IVSR also compute find_natural_loops). These passes
run sequentially within the same pipeline iteration. GVN does not modify the CFG
(only replaces instruction operands), so the analysis results are still valid for
LICM and IVSR.

This results in 3 redundant build_cfg calls, 3 redundant compute_dominators calls,
and 1 redundant find_natural_loops call per function per iteration.

Solution:
1. Create a shared CfgAnalysis struct holding label_to_idx, preds, succs, idom,
   dom_children, and loops.
2. Compute it once per function at the start of the GVN+LICM+IVSR sequence.
3. Pass it into GVN, LICM, and IVSR so they reuse the same analysis.
4. Benchmark to verify speedup.

Expected improvement: ~15-20% reduction in analysis overhead for these passes,
which represent ~3-5% of total compile time on large files.
