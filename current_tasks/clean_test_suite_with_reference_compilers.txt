Task: Clean test suite by validating against reference compilers

Status: in_progress

Goal: Run gcc and clang (for all backends: x86, arm, riscv, i686) over the
test suite in code/tests/ to find tests that fail with reference compilers.
Remove or fix tests that fail for bad reasons (e.g., undefined behavior,
compiler-specific assumptions). Then run our compiler over the remaining
tests and fix any real issues found.

Approach:
1. Compile and run all tests with gcc/clang for each backend
2. Note tests that fail with any reference compiler
3. Remove tests that rely on undefined behavior or are invalid
4. Fix tests that have wrong expected output
5. Run our compiler and fix any real bugs found
