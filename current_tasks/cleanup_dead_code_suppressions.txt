Task: Remove unjustified #[allow(dead_code)] and fix stale dead_code comments

Scope:
- Remove #[allow(dead_code)] from IrFunction and IrParam (both are heavily used)
- Remove #[allow(dead_code)] from StructMixedIntSseReg/StructMixedSseIntReg CallArgClass variants
  (these ARE used by x86 and RISC-V backends, the comment is stale)
- Fix stale "not yet consumed" comments on those variants
- Review remaining #[allow(dead_code)] for correctness
- Verify no regressions

Status: in_progress
