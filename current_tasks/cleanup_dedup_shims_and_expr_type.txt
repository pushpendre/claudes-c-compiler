Cleanup: Remove backward-compat shims and deduplicate expr type inference

1. Remove codegen_shared.rs re-export shim - update 5 backend files to import
   from individual modules (state, traits, generation, call_abi, call_emit, cast,
   inline_asm) instead of using the glob re-export.

2. Remove dead type_context.rs in ir/lowering/ - it's a 9-line re-export shim
   that has no consumers (mod.rs already re-exports TypeContext directly).

3. Unify infer_expr_type() and get_expr_type() - two parallel ~100-line match
   dispatches over the same Expr enum with subtle differences. Merge into a
   single function.

4. Unify the duplicated helper functions (wrap_result, unsigned_op, bool_to_i64)
   between sema/const_eval.rs and lowering/const_eval.rs into a shared module.

Status: in progress
