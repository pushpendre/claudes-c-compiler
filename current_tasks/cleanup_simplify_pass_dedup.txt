Clean up passes/simplify.rs: reduce duplication and code bloat

- Extract helper functions to eliminate copy-paste patterns
- Table-driven intrinsic lowering instead of repeated match arms
- Consolidate fold_const_cast dual match blocks
- Add test helpers to reduce 1000 lines of test boilerplate
- Normalize commutative patterns (mul power-of-2, cmp with zero)
- Target: reduce from ~2039 lines to ~1400-1500 lines

Status: completed
