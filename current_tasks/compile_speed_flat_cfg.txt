Task: Improve compile speed by replacing Vec<Vec<usize>> CFG with flat CSR representation
Status: in_progress
Started: 2026-01-27

Problem: The compiler spends ~13% of time in malloc/free during compilation of
large files (e.g., sqlite3.c). A major contributor is build_cfg() in analysis.rs,
which creates Vec<Vec<usize>> for predecessor/successor lists - this requires n+1
heap allocations per call, and the CFG is rebuilt by GVN, LICM, if_convert each
per function per iteration.

Approach: Replace Vec<Vec<usize>> in build_cfg with a flat CSR (Compressed Sparse
Row) representation using two flat arrays: offsets[] and data[]. This reduces n+1
allocations to 2 allocations per build_cfg call and improves cache locality.

Key files:
- src/ir/analysis.rs (add FlatCfg type, modify build_cfg)
- src/passes/gvn.rs (update to use FlatCfg)
- src/passes/licm.rs (update to use FlatCfg)
- src/passes/if_convert.rs (update to use FlatCfg)
- src/ir/mem2reg/ (update to use FlatCfg)
