Task: Consolidate duplicated IR helper functions
Status: in_progress
Started: 2026-01-27

Problem:
Several utility functions are duplicated across different modules:

1. instruction_used_values() and terminator_used_values() exist in both
   passes/inline.rs and ir/mem2reg/mem2reg.rs with divergent implementations.
   The inline.rs version is incomplete (uses catch-all wildcard, misses many
   instruction variants). The mem2reg.rs version is comprehensive.

2. Three nearly-identical collect_global_init_refs_* functions in passes/mod.rs
   all walk the same GlobalInit tree but differ only in their collection target
   (Vec<String>, HashSet<&str>, Vec<bool>). These can be unified into a single
   generic traversal with a callback.

3. Clean up completed task files from current_tasks/ that are cluttering the
   directory.

Approach:
- Move the comprehensive instruction_used_values/terminator_used_values into
  ir/ir.rs as methods or associated functions on Instruction/Terminator
- Update inline.rs and mem2reg.rs to call the shared versions
- Replace the three collect_global_init_refs_* with a single for_each_global_init_ref
  callback-based traversal
- Remove completed task files from current_tasks/
