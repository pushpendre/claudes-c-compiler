Lock: ctype_struct_arc_to_string (commit 5 of lowerer decomposition)

Change CType::Struct(Arc<StructType>) → CType::Struct(String) and
CType::Union(Arc<StructType>) → CType::Union(String).

TypeContext becomes the sole owner of struct/union definitions.
CType::size() and CType::align() take &TypeContext and resolve through it.
All Arc<StructType> construction becomes TypeContext insertion + returning the key.

This eliminates the entire class of forward-declaration staleness bugs.
