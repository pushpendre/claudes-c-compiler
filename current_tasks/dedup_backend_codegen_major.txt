Major backend codegen deduplication refactor.

Extract shared logic from x86/arm/riscv codegen files into codegen_shared.rs:
1. emit_cast: shared CastKind match dispatch with arch-specific instruction callbacks
2. emit_binop: shared float binop dispatch and integer op structure
3. emit_call: shared argument classification logic (register vs stack assignment)
4. emit_inline_asm: shared 4-phase operand handling framework
5. Small helpers: load/store type dispatch, string literal helpers

Goal: Reduce ~5500 lines of duplicated code across 3 backends to shared framework + arch tables.
