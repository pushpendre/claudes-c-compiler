Task: Deduplicate regalloc setup boilerplate across 3 backends

All 3 backends (x86/ARM/RISC-V) repeat identical code in calculate_stack_space:
- Build available_regs from arch callee-saved, filtering out ASM clobbers
- Run regalloc::allocate_registers
- Store assignments + used_callee_saved
- Merge ASM clobber regs into used_callee_saved (dedup)
- Sort, build reg_assigned set

Extract shared helper that takes callee_saved + asm_clobbered as inputs.
Also deduplicate the inline-asm callee-saved scan loop (x86 + RISC-V).
