Dominator-based GVN with extended value numbering

Task: Extend GVN from local (intra-block) to dominator-based (cross-block).
Also extend ExprKey to value-number Cast and GetElementPtr instructions.

Steps:
1. Extract dominator tree and CFG from mem2reg into shared ir/analysis.rs
2. Upgrade gvn.rs to walk the dominator tree with scoped hash tables
3. Add Cast and GetElementPtr to ExprKey for value numbering
4. Run benchmarks to verify improvement on zlib/libjpeg
