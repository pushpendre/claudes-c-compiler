Task: Eliminate dead parameter allocas to reduce stack frame sizes
Status: in_progress

Problem:
Every function with N parameters wastes N*8 bytes of stack space because mem2reg
cannot remove parameter alloca instructions. The backend relies on find_param_alloca()
which uses positional indexing (the i-th Alloca in the entry block = parameter i).
Removing any alloca shifts indices and breaks the convention.

Additionally, emit_store_params emits dead stores into these slots for promoted parameters
(the values are never read back from the slot since mem2reg promoted them to SSA values).

This inflates stack frames and adds unnecessary prologue code. For a function with 6 params,
that's 48 bytes + 6 dead stores wasted.

Fix plan:
1. Add a param_slots field to IrFunction that maps param index -> alloca Value
2. Populate this during lowering when parameter allocas are created
3. Update mem2reg to allow removing promoted parameter allocas
4. Update find_param_alloca to use the new mapping instead of positional scanning
5. If param was promoted (no alloca in IR), emit_store_params skips storing it
6. Update DCE to allow removing allocas that have no uses
