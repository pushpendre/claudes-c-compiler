Extract TypeContext from Lowerer (decomposition commit 3)

Pull type-system state into its own struct:
- struct_layouts, typedefs, function_typedefs, enum_constants, ctype_cache,
  var_ctypes, func_return_ctypes, const_local_values

Methods like resolve_ctype_size, type_spec_to_ctype, get_struct_layout become
methods on TypeContext. Lowerer holds a TypeContext field.

Status: IN PROGRESS
