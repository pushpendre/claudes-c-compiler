Fix alloca coalescing causing stack slot overlap with temporaries
================================================================

Bug: When stack slot coalescing is enabled, alloca instructions (local arrays,
structs) could be coalesced into the block-local pool. Since the coalescing
pool is shared across blocks, an alloca's memory could overlap with temporary
values from other blocks that access the alloca's memory through derived
pointers (GEPs).

Root cause: The alloca coalescing logic only tracked direct uses of the alloca
pointer value, not indirect uses through GEP chains. An alloca whose pointer
was used in only one block could be coalesced, but memory at that address
might be accessed from many blocks via derived GEP pointers.

Fix: Never coalesce allocas. Allocas represent addressable memory that can be
accessed indirectly, making them unsafe to coalesce without full alias analysis.
Only non-alloca SSA values (temporaries) are coalesced.

Impact: Fixes 4 test failures (array-init-001, compiler_suite_0036_0013,
compiler_suite_0148_0056, compiler_suite_0149_0052). Zero regressions.

Status: COMPLETE - ready to commit and push.
