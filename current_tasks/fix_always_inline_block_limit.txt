Task: Increase always_inline block limit for kernel mutex functions
Status: in_progress

Problem:
  kernel/locking/mutex.c has __mutex_lock_common marked __always_inline, but
  the function generates 215 IR basic blocks (312 instructions), exceeding our
  MAX_ALWAYS_INLINE_BLOCKS limit of 200. This causes the inliner to skip it,
  leaving an undefined reference to __mutex_lock_common in the object file.

  GCC has no block count limit for __always_inline functions — it always
  inlines them regardless of size.

Fix:
  Increase MAX_ALWAYS_INLINE_BLOCKS from 200 to accommodate large always_inline
  kernel functions like __mutex_lock_common. Since __always_inline is a programmer
  directive, we should respect it without arbitrary limits.

  Also need to make sure the caller budget (MAX_ALWAYS_INLINE_BUDGET_PER_CALLER)
  is sufficient, since large inlined functions consume a lot of budget.
