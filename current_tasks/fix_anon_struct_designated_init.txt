Fix designated initializers for anonymous struct/union members

Designated initializers like { .x = 10, .y = 20, .z = 30 } silently produce
all-zero values when the target fields belong to anonymous struct or union
members. For example:

  struct point {
      struct { int x; int y; };  // anonymous struct
      int z;
  };
  struct point p = { .x = 10, .y = 20, .z = 30 };
  // CCC: x=0 y=0 z=0 (wrong)
  // GCC: x=10 y=20 z=30 (correct)

The issue is in the initializer lowering code which doesn't resolve designated
field names through anonymous struct/union members to find the correct offset.
