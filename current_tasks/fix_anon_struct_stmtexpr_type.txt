Task: Fix anonymous struct member access type in statement expressions
Status: in_progress

Problem:
Anonymous struct member access inside statement expressions (used by Linux kernel's
get_unaligned() macro) was returning the wrong type (int/32-bit instead of the actual
member type). This caused lib/string.c memcmp to use 32-bit comparisons for
unsigned long values, breaking kernel boot.

Root cause:
The sema type checker's resolve_type_spec() returned CType::Int for anonymous structs
because it couldn't generate unique struct keys. The lowerer's get_expr_type() for
StmtExpr also couldn't resolve the type because the inner variables hadn't been
lowered yet when pre-lowering type queries were made.

Fix:
1. Added anonymous struct/union layout computation to sema type checker's
   resolve_type_spec(), using TypeContext::next_anon_struct_id() to generate keys
2. Added CType-based fallback in lowerer's get_expr_type() for StmtExpr, so sema
   annotations are used when direct IR type resolution fails
