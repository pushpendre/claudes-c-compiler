Task: Fix ARM miscompilation of drivers/acpi/acpica/dswload.c causing kernel boot hang

Status: in_progress

Problem:
When drivers/acpi/acpica/dswload.c is compiled with ccc-arm and swapped into
a GCC-built kernel, the kernel hangs during boot (400s timeout).

This was found using the delta debugging tool with --seed 42 --total-count 500.
The file is part of the ACPI subsystem (AML namespace loading/walking).

Plan:
1. Compare GCC vs CCC assembly output for dswload.c
2. Identify the miscompiled function(s)
3. Write a minimal reproducer
4. Fix the compiler bug
5. Verify the fix with DD tool
6. Add regression test
