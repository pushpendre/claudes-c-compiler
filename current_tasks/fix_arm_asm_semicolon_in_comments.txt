Fix ARM assembler: split_on_semicolons doesn't respect // comments

Problem: When assembling .s files with // comments that contain semicolons
(e.g., musl's src/ldso/aarch64/tlsdesc.s), the split_on_semicolons function
splits on ; inside // comments, creating garbage fragments that fail to parse.

Example:
  // struct {size_t modidx,off;} *p = (void*)a[1];
Gets split into:
  1. "// struct {size_t modidx,off"  (treated as comment - OK)
  2. "} *p = (void*)a[1]"  (parsed as instruction - FAILS)

Fix: Make split_on_semicolons stop splitting when it encounters // (outside strings).

This also affects the shared asm_preprocess.rs split_on_semicolons used by other backends.
