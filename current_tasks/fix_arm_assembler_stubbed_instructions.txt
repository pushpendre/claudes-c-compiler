Task: Fix ARM assembler stubbed instruction encodings
Status: in_progress
Description: The native AArch64 assembler has several instructions that emit NOP
placeholders instead of correct encodings. This task fixes:
- fcvtzs/fcvtzu (float-to-int conversion)
- scvtf/ucvtf (int-to-float conversion)
- fcvt (precision conversion)
- cnt (NEON popcount)
- uaddlv (NEON horizontal add)
- fmov with float immediates
- Any other encoding bugs found via compare_asm.py
