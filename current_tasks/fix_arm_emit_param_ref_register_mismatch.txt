Fix ARM emit_param_ref register width mismatch regression.

The recent commit a3307c7 ("Enable mem2reg promotion of parameter allocas") introduced
emit_param_ref for ARM, but it generated invalid `mov x0, wN` instructions (mixing 32-bit
and 64-bit register widths, which ARM64 doesn't allow).

Fix: Use matching register widths in mov instructions, and route StackScalar loads through
arm_parse_load to correctly handle ldrsw and ldr32/ldr64 pseudo-instructions.

Status: in_progress
