Task: Fix ARM I32 constant sign-extension to 64-bit register

Bug: When loading IrConst::I32 values with large negative magnitudes into x0 on ARM,
the backend zero-extends instead of sign-extending. For example, I32(-1073741824)
(0xC0000000) gets loaded as 0x00000000C0000000 instead of 0xFFFFFFFFC0000000.

Root cause: operand_to_x0() for IrConst::I32 decomposed the value as u32 into two
16-bit halves using mov/movk, which zero-extends to 64 bits. Negative I32 values
need the upper 32 bits set to 0xFFFFFFFF for correct sign extension.

Fix: Use emit_load_imm64 with sign-extended i64 value (*v as i64) instead of u32
decomposition for large I32 constants.

Impact: Fixes mquickjs test_builtin.js failure on ARM (Uint8Array typed arrays
returned undefined values due to int64_is_short_int() returning wrong results).

Status: IN PROGRESS
