Fix ARM inline asm load_input_to_reg not checking is_alloca

Bug: ARM backend's load_input_to_reg always emits "ldr" (load from memory)
for Value operands, but when the value IS an alloca (e.g., a local array used
as an inline asm input), it should emit "add" to compute the address instead.

This caused musl's tmpfile() to fail on ARM because the openat syscall received
the array contents instead of its address (EFAULT).

Status: in_progress
