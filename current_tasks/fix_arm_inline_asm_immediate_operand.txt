Task: Fix ARM inline asm immediate operand substitution

The ARM backend's inline asm template substitution doesn't handle "i" (immediate)
constraint operands. When %[name] references an immediate operand, the ARM backend
only looks at the register name (which is empty for immediates), resulting in empty
substitution.

This causes the kernel's alternative_has_cap_unlikely() asm goto to emit:
    .hword
instead of:
    .hword 31

The empty .hword emits 0 bytes, corrupting the .altinstructions section layout
and causing boot failures on ARM.

Fix: Update substitute_asm_operands_static() and substitute_template_line() in the
ARM backend to pass and handle imm_value/imm_symbol for immediate operands, similar
to how x86 and RISC-V backends already handle them.

Status: complete
