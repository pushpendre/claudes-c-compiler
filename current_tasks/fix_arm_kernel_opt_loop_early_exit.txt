Task: Fix ARM kernel build failure due to optimization loop early exit
Status: completed
Branch: master

Problem:
ARM kernel build fails with undefined references to restore_tpidr2_context,
restore_za_context, restore_zt_context in arch/arm64/kernel/signal.o.

Root cause:
DCE removes many dead instructions in optimization iteration 0, inflating
the iter0 change count. The diminishing returns heuristic (5% threshold)
then terminates the optimization loop after only 2 iterations, before the
constant propagation chain through cpucap_is_possible ->
alternative_has_cap_unlikely -> system_supports_sme is fully folded.

Fix:
1. Exclude DCE changes from the diminishing returns calculation (mod.rs)
2. Require at least 2 full iterations before diminishing returns check (mod.rs)
3. Skip if_convert for constant conditions that cfg_simplify should fold (if_convert.rs)

Files modified:
- src/passes/mod.rs: Diminishing returns heuristic improvements
- src/passes/if_convert.rs: Skip constant-condition branches
- tests/opt-loop-dce-diminishing-returns/: Regression test
