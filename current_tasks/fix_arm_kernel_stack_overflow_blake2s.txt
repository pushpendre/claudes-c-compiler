Task: Fix ARM kernel stack overflow in blake2s_compress_generic
Status: in_progress
Branch: master

Problem:
ARM kernel hangs during boot after "clocksource: Switched to clocksource arch_sys_counter"
because blake2s_compress_generic() overflows the kernel's 16KB stack.

Root cause:
The stack layout's Tier 3 (block-local coalescing) assigns each single-block value
its own dedicated stack slot, without within-block liveness-based reuse. For functions
with one large basic block containing many short-lived temporaries (e.g., blake2s_compress
with 320 ror32() calls generating ~2700 temporaries in the loop body), this creates a
~22KB block-local pool that overflows the kernel's 16KB stack.

Fix:
Route values from blocks with >128 block-local values to Tier 2 (liveness-based packing)
instead of Tier 3. Tier 2 reuses slots for values with non-overlapping lifetimes,
reducing the stack frame from 28KB to 560 bytes for blake2s_compress.

File modified:
- src/backend/stack_layout.rs: Large-block Tier 2 fallback
