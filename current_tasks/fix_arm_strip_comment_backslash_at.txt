Fix ARM assembler strip_comment regression: backslash-@ treated as comment

The strip_comment() function in parser.rs treats @ as a GAS line comment character.
When called before macro expansion (in the presplit phase), it incorrectly strips
\@ (GAS macro invocation counter) and everything after it from labels like
.Lventry_start\@: and .Ldcache_op\@:, leaving broken labels like .Lventry_start\
that fail to parse.

Fix: skip @ when preceded by backslash, since \@ is a macro parameter, not a comment.
