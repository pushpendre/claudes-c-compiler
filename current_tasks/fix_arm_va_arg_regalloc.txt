Fix ARM AArch64 va_arg/va_start/va_copy register allocation bug

Problem:
ARM backend's emit_va_arg, emit_va_start, and emit_va_copy always loaded
the va_list pointer from the stack slot, but when the value was register-
allocated by the linear scan allocator, store_x0_to() only stored to the
callee-saved register (skipping the stack slot). This caused SIGSEGV when
the codegen tried to load from an uninitialized stack slot.

Fix:
Check register allocation assignments before loading va_list pointers,
matching the pattern already used by x86 and RISC-V backends.

Impact: Fixes ~14+ ARM struct-passing varargs tests that were SIGSEGV'ing.
