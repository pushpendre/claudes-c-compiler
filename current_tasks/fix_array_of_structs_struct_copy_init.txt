Fix local array-of-structs init not doing full struct copy for struct-valued expressions

Bug: When initializing a local array of structs where an initializer element
is a struct-valued expression (e.g., dereferencing a struct pointer), only
the first field is copied instead of the entire struct.

Example:
    struct data { long data_l1; long data_l2; };
    void sub(struct data *xxx, long n, long vvv) {
        const struct data aaa[1] = {*xxx};  // BUG: only copies data_l1
        ...
    }

Root cause: In lower_array_of_structs_init (stmt_init.rs), the Expr branch
(line ~435) calls emit_struct_init which treats the expression as flat
scalar values for individual fields. It should first check struct_value_size
and emit a memcpy for the whole struct, matching the pattern already used
in emit_struct_init for nested struct fields (stmt.rs line ~1374).

Fix: Before calling emit_struct_init, check if expression is struct-valued
using struct_value_size(). If so, emit memcpy. Apply to both the normal
and multidim code paths.

Status: LOCKED
