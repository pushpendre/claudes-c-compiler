Task: Fix asm goto target blocks being incorrectly merged in cfg_simplify

Problem: merge_single_pred_blocks() in cfg_simplify.rs doesn't count InlineAsm
goto_labels as CFG edges when computing predecessor counts. This causes asm goto
target blocks (e.g., t_yes, t_no in _static_cpu_has) to appear to have only 1
predecessor (the terminator-based edge), when they actually have additional
predecessors from InlineAsm goto_labels.

The merged block gets Terminator::Unreachable (ud2), but the InlineAsm still
references the old block label, causing the asm goto to jump to ud2 instead of
the intended code.

This causes the Linux kernel to crash during boot in pat_bp_init() because
_static_cpu_has's asm goto t_yes label jumps to ud2 instead of "return true".

Fix: Include InlineAsm goto_labels in predecessor counting in merge_single_pred_blocks.
