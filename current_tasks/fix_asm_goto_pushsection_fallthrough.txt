Task: fix_asm_goto_pushsection_fallthrough
Status: in_progress
Description:
  When asm goto with unsatisfiable "i" constraints and .pushsection is
  skipped, the compiler incorrectly jumps to the last goto label instead
  of falling through to the next statement. This breaks the kernel's
  arch_static_branch / jump label pattern (used in tracepoints and static
  keys), causing tracepoints to always appear active and boot failures.

  The fix removes the incorrect jump-to-last-label behavior and instead
  falls through (matching GCC's asm goto semantics). This is correct for
  both arch_static_branch (fallthrough = return false) and _static_cpu_has
  (fallthrough = t_yes = return true, matching GCC un-patched NOP behavior).
