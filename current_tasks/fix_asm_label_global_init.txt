Task: Fix __asm__ label redirect in global initializers and address-of expressions

Problem:
When a function is declared with __asm__("symbol") (glibc's __REDIRECT mechanism),
the asm label is correctly applied for direct calls and local identifier expressions,
but NOT for:
1. Global/static initializers: (void*)stat in a static array resolves to "stat" not "stat64"
2. Address-of expressions in lower_address_of: &func uses name directly without redirect

Impact:
- sqlite3.c defines _FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64, causing glibc to use __REDIRECT to map
  stat -> stat64, fstat -> fstat64, etc.
- sqlite stores function pointers in static aSyscall[] array: (sqlite3_syscall_ptr)stat
- On i686, the non-redirected stat() uses a different struct stat layout (88 bytes)
  vs stat64 (96 bytes, st_ino at offset 88 instead of 12)
- This causes fileHasMoved() to read uninitialized memory for st_ino, returning true,
  which triggers SQLITE_READONLY_DBMOVED error on all INSERT/UPDATE operations
- 620/622 sqlite tests fail due to this bug

Fix:
Apply asm_label_map lookup in:
1. const_eval_global_addr.rs: eval_global_addr_expr() when resolving function names
2. expr_access.rs: lower_address_of() fallback path for function identifiers
