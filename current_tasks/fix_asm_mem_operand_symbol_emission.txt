Task: Fix inline asm memory operand emitted as immediate ($symbol) instead of memory reference
Status: in_progress

Problem:
In emit_operand_with_modifier(), the symbol-immediate check (emitting "$symbol") was
tested before the memory operand check (emitting mem_addr). This caused "+m" constraint
operands that also have imm_symbol set (from extract_mem_operand_symbol) to be emitted
as "$pcpu_hot+8" instead of "%gs:pcpu_hot+8(%rip)", causing assembler errors on many
kernel files (fs/ext4/file.c, arch/x86/mm/fault.c, kernel/signal.c, etc.).

Fix:
Reorder the checks in emit_operand_with_modifier() so memory operands are emitted
via their mem_addr before the symbol/immediate fallbacks.
