Task: Fix atomic ordering consistency across all three backends

Problem:
The IR correctly represents AtomicOrdering (Relaxed, Acquire, Release, AcqRel, SeqCst)
for all atomic operations, but x86 and ARM backends completely ignore the ordering
parameter (all parameters named _ordering), always emitting the strongest semantics.
RISC-V correctly handles ordering for RMW/CmpXchg/Store but ignores it for Load and Fence.

Issues:
1. x86 emit_atomic_store always emits mfence (even for Relaxed stores on TSO - unnecessary)
2. x86 emit_fence always emits mfence (should be nop for Relaxed, nothing for Acquire)
3. ARM emit_atomic_rmw uses ldxr/stxr (no ordering) instead of ldaxr/stlxr for SeqCst/AcqRel
4. ARM emit_atomic_cmpxchg uses ldxr/stxr (no ordering) instead of ldaxr/stlxr
5. ARM emit_atomic_load always uses ldar (acquire) even for Relaxed
6. ARM emit_atomic_store always uses stlr (release) even for Relaxed
7. ARM emit_fence always emits dmb ish regardless of ordering
8. RISC-V emit_atomic_load ignores ordering (always .aq for word/dword, always full fence for sub-word)
9. RISC-V emit_fence always emits fence rw, rw regardless of ordering

Fix: Make all three backends respect the AtomicOrdering parameter appropriately
for each architecture's memory model.

Status: IN PROGRESS
