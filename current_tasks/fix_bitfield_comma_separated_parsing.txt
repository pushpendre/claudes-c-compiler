Task: Fix comma-separated bitfield declarations in struct field parsing

Bug: The parser uses parse_expr() for bitfield width expressions, which includes
the comma operator. This causes "int a : 4, b : 4;" to be parsed incorrectly -
the "4, b" is interpreted as a comma expression, consuming the second field name.

Fix: Use parse_assignment_expr() instead of parse_expr() for bitfield width
expressions in parse_struct_field_declarators. This matches C grammar where
bitfield widths are constant-expressions (which do not include comma operator
at the top level).

This is needed for redis (struct tcp_info), and many system headers that use
comma-separated bitfield declarations.

Status: In progress
