Task: Fix bitfield packing in global struct compound initialization

Problem:
When a struct has both pointer/address fields AND bitfield members, global
initialization takes the "compound" path (lower_struct_global_init_compound)
which supports relocations. However, this path does NOT handle bitfield packing.

Each bitfield member is treated as a full-width independent field, emitting
its raw value as individual bytes rather than packing multiple bitfield values
into their shared storage unit.

Example:
  struct entry {
      void (*handler)(void);
      unsigned int max_length :12;
      unsigned int min_length :8;
  };
  static struct entry table[] = { { handler_func, 13, 7 } };

The handler pointer forces the compound path, but then max_length and
min_length are emitted as separate full-size fields instead of being packed
into a single 32-bit bitfield storage unit.

Result: Bitfield values read as wrong values at runtime (shifted or zero).

Fix: In lower_struct_global_init_compound, detect consecutive bitfield
fields sharing the same storage unit offset, group them, pack them correctly
using write_bitfield_to_bytes, and emit as packed bytes.

Impact: This fixes libpng runtime failure (IHDR chunk dispatch table
bitfields read as 0), and likely affects other projects using structs
with both function pointers and bitfields.
