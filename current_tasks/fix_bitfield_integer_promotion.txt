Task: Fix bitfield integer promotion for wide base types (uint64_t, int64_t)

Problem:
When a bitfield has a wide base type like uint64_t (e.g., `uint64_t arg_count : 16`),
the compiler incorrectly kept the promoted type as uint64_t instead of int.

Per C11 6.3.1.1p2: "If an int can represent all values of the original type
(as restricted by the width, for a bit-field), the value is converted to an int."
A 16-bit unsigned bitfield has values 0..65535, which all fit in int (signed 32-bit),
so it must promote to int regardless of the declared base type.

This caused signed/unsigned comparison mismatches that broke mquickjs (the quickjs
JS engine), where `int var_idx >= uint64_t:16 arg_count` was treated as unsigned.

Fix:
Updated bitfield_promoted_type() in src/ir/lowering/expr_types.rs to handle all
base types uniformly based on bitfield width:
- Signed bitfield with width <= 32: promote to I32
- Unsigned bitfield with width <= 31: promote to I32
- Unsigned bitfield with width == 32: promote to U32
- Wider bitfields: keep original type

Status: in progress
