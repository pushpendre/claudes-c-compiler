Fix three parser/sema issues:

1. Bitfield integer promotion: unsigned bitfields narrower than int should
   promote to int (signed) per C11 6.3.1.1p2. Currently unsigned bitfields
   like `unsigned int u : 7` get type U32 which causes incorrect unsigned
   arithmetic in expressions like `i % bit.u`.

2. Bool predefinition: `bool` is predefined as a builtin macro expanding to
   `_Bool`, but in C11 it should only be defined by <stdbool.h>. This breaks
   `typedef _Bool bool;` in code that doesn't include stdbool.h.

3. GNU ?: extension: Support the GCC conditional expression with omitted
   middle operand (`x ? : y`), equivalent to `x ? x : y`.
