Fix _Bool bitfield assignment: missing boolean conversion

Problem:
When assigning a non-zero/non-one integer value to a _Bool bitfield,
the compiler truncates to the bit width (1 bit) instead of first
converting the value to _Bool (0 or 1) as required by the C standard.

Example:
  struct { _Bool a : 1; } s;
  s.a = 2;  // Should store 1 (bool conversion), but stores 0 (bit truncation)

The C standard (6.3.1.2) requires that when converting to _Bool,
the result is 0 if the value is 0, and 1 otherwise. This conversion
must happen BEFORE the bitfield truncation.

Fix:
In the bitfield store lowering code, insert a bool conversion
(compare != 0) before the bitfield mask/shift operation when the
target bitfield type is _Bool.
