Fix __builtin_bswap16/__builtin_bswap32 return type: signed -> unsigned

Problem:
__builtin_bswap16 and __builtin_bswap32 were typed as returning signed int
(CType::Int / IrType::I32). GCC returns unsigned types (uint16_t / uint32_t).
The signed return type caused right-shift operations on bswap results to use
arithmetic shift (sarl) instead of logical shift (shrl), corrupting values
when bit 31 is set.

This broke the ARIA cipher in mbedtls on i686, where ARIA_P1(x) =
rotate16(bswap32(x)) uses >> 16 on a bswap32 result. With signed typing,
values like bswap32(0xDEADBEEF) = 0xEFBEADDE would produce 0xFFFFEFBE
instead of 0x0000EFBE when right-shifted by 16.

Fix:
1. type_checker.rs: Changed __builtin_bswap16/__builtin_bswap32 from
   CType::Int to CType::UInt
2. expr_types.rs: Removed shadowing match that incorrectly mapped
   bswap16/bswap32 to IrType::I32, allowing the existing correct
   matches (bswap16 => U16, bswap32 => U32) to be reached

Results:
- mbedtls i686: ARIA-ECB-128 now passes (7/7 tests pass)
- i686 unit tests: 529/531 (99.6%) - same as before, no regressions
- x86-64 unit tests: 618/620 (99.7%) - same as before, no regressions

Status: completed
