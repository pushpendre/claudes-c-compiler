Fix __builtin_bswap16/32 return types to unsigned

Problem:
__builtin_bswap16 and __builtin_bswap32 were typed as returning signed int
in both the sema type checker (CType::Int) and the IR lowering
(IrType::I32). GCC documents these as returning unsigned short and
unsigned int respectively.

The signed return type caused the expression (__builtin_bswap32(x)) >> 16
to use arithmetic right shift (sarq) instead of logical right shift (shrq),
producing wrong results when the high bit of the bswap result was set.

This broke mbedTLS's ARIA cipher self-test on both x86 and i686, because
the ARIA_P1 macro on x86 is defined as ARIA_P2(ARIA_P3(x)) where
ARIA_P3 = __builtin_bswap32 and ARIA_P2 = ((x)>>16)^((x)<<16).

Fix:
1. type_checker.rs: Changed bswap16 -> CType::UShort, bswap32 -> CType::UInt
2. expr_builtins_intrin.rs: Changed bswap IR types to U16/U32/U64

Status: in_progress
