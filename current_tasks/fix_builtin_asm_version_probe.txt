Fix MY_ASM=builtin assembler version probe for kernel build

When MY_ASM=builtin is set, the kernel build system probes the assembler version
by running: $CC -Wa,--version -c -x assembler-with-cpp /dev/null -o /dev/null

It expects the output to contain "GNU assembler ... <version>" so it can parse
the assembler version. Our builtin assembler silently succeeds without outputting
anything, causing as-version.sh to fail with "unknown assembler invoked".

Fix: When assembler_extra_args contains --version and MY_ASM=builtin, print a
GNU-compatible version string to stdout before assembling. This satisfies the
kernel's Kconfig assembler version check.

Status: in_progress
