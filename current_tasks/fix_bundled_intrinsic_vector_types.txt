Fix: Add missing internal vector type definitions to bundled SSE headers

The bundled emmintrin.h and xmmintrin.h headers were missing the internal
vector type definitions (__v2di, __v4si, __v2df, etc.) that GCC's system
headers (wmmintrin.h, immintrin.h) reference. This caused parse errors
when including <immintrin.h> or <wmmintrin.h>.

Added all 10 SSE2 vector types to emmintrin.h and __v4sf to xmmintrin.h.
Fixes 5 x86 asm tests. No regressions on any architecture.

Status: COMPLETE
