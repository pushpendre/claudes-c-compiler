Task: Fix C99 inline function linkage - emit weak external symbol
Status: in_progress

Problem:
C99 "inline" functions (non-static, non-extern, no gnu_inline) are currently
treated as static (internal linkage), which means they get dead-code eliminated
and no external symbol is produced. This causes "undefined reference" link errors
when other translation units call these functions without inlining them.

Example: jq's tsd_dtoa_context_get() is declared "inline" in jv_dtoa_tsd.c.
Since our compiler doesn't inline across TUs, jv_print.o references the symbol
but jv_dtoa_tsd.o doesn't export it, causing link failure on all architectures.

GCC emits these functions with weak external linkage at -O0 (when it can't inline).
At -O2, GCC inlines them and the symbol disappears. Since we don't inline, we must
always emit them.

Fix:
- In func_lowering.rs: Change C99 inline functions from static to non-static + weak
- In dead_statics.rs: Ensure weak C99 inline functions are not eliminated as dead
- This matches GCC -O0 behavior where inline functions get external (weak) linkage
