Fix CFG simplify: fold_constant_cond_branches doesn't clean up phi nodes

Problem:
When fold_constant_cond_branches folds a CondBranch with a constant condition
into an unconditional Branch, it removes a control-flow edge but does NOT
clean up phi nodes in the not-taken target block. This leaves stale phi
entries referencing a predecessor that no longer branches to that block.

Later, remove_dead_blocks removes the stale phi entries only if the not-taken
block becomes completely unreachable. But if the not-taken block is still
reachable from other predecessors, the stale phi entries remain and can
produce wrong values.

Impact:
Causes kernel boot failures (miscompilation of many .c files). Confirmed by
bisecting: disabling fold_constant_cond_branches OR remove_dead_blocks fixes
the kernel boot for the affected files.

Fix:
When folding a CondBranch to Branch, clean up phi nodes in the not-taken
target block by removing entries that reference the current block.
