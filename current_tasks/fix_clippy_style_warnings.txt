Task: Fix clippy style warnings across the codebase

Status: in_progress

Goal: Address the most impactful clippy lint warnings to improve Rust
idiomatic style. This is complementary to the "eliminate_compiler_warnings"
task which focuses on dead code warnings.

Specific fixes:
- Remove .clone() on Copy types (use copy semantics instead) - 71 occurrences
- Convert file-level doc comments (///) to inner doc comments (//!) - 15 occurrences
- Replace manual div_ceil with .div_ceil() - 22 occurrences
- Replace manual prefix stripping with .strip_prefix() - 10 occurrences
- Other idiomatic fixes: map_or simplification, collapsible if statements,
  RangeInclusive::contains, redundant closures, etc.

Approach: Non-functional changes only. Fix clippy lints to make the code
more idiomatic Rust. Run full test suite to ensure zero regressions.
