Fix complex type ABI for function calls and returns

Problem:
- _Complex double is passed as a pointer (in integer register) instead of as
  two doubles in XMM registers (x86-64 SysV ABI)
- _Complex double return uses sret instead of xmm0+xmm1
- Similar issues on ARM64 (should use two FP registers) and RISC-V (fa0+fa1)
- This causes cabs(), creal(), etc. to receive garbage when called with complex args

Fix approach:
- At function call sites, decompose complex arguments into real+imag parts
- Pass them as separate float values with correct ABI register assignment
- For function definitions, receive complex params as separate float values
- Fix return convention for _Complex double (xmm0+xmm1 on x86, d0+d1 on ARM, fa0+fa1 on RISC-V)
- _Complex float (8 bytes) can stay as single register on x86 (already works)
- _Complex long double stays as memory/sret (already correct)
