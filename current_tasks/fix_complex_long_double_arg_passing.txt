Task: Fix _Complex long double argument passing ABI mismatch

Problem: The IR lowering always decomposes _Complex long double into 2 F128
scalar components at call sites, but the callee treats it as ParamKind::Struct
(expecting a pointer). This causes completely wrong argument passing on all
three backends.

Correct ABI per platform:
- x86-64: Pass on stack (MEMORY class), do NOT decompose
- ARM64:  Pass in Q0/Q1 registers (HFA), DO decompose into 2 F128 values
- RISC-V: Pass by reference (pointer), do NOT decompose

Fix plan:
1. Make decompose_complex_call_args platform-aware for ComplexLongDouble
2. On ARM64: keep decomposition, and change build_ir_params to use
   ComplexDecomposed with F128 components for callee
3. On x86/RISC-V: stop decomposing, keep as struct pointer
4. Ensure ComplexLongDouble function return also works correctly

Impact: Fixes ~100+ failing tests across all platforms related to complex
number operations (the majority of remaining failures).
