Fix conditional expression (ternary) type resolution when one branch is void*

get_expr_ctype for Conditional expressions (line 1609 in expr_types.rs) currently
just returns the type of the 'then' branch. This is wrong when one branch is void*
and the other is T* — per C semantics, the composite type should be T*.

This causes sizeof(*(cond ? (void*)e : (int*)8)) to return 1 instead of 4,
which breaks the kernel's __builtin_choose_expr type-checking pattern used in
min/max macros, causing ~30 files to fail with "could not resolve type of 'typeof'
expression" during defconfig build.

Fix: Update get_expr_ctype's Conditional arm to compute proper composite type,
especially handling void* + T* → T* and T* + void* → T*.
