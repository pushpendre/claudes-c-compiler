Fix the const_arith.rs negate_const() function which panics with
"attempt to negate with overflow" when negating i64::MIN or i32::MIN.

This affects 5 compiler_suite tests that use -9223372036854775808LL or
-9223372036854775808.0L patterns. The fix is to use wrapping_neg()
instead of the unary minus operator, consistent with how other parts
of the compiler handle this (preprocessor, passes, parser).

Tests affected:
- compiler_suite_0048_0237
- compiler_suite_0048_0239
- compiler_suite_0048_0245
- compiler_suite_0137_0503
- compiler_suite_0139_0167
