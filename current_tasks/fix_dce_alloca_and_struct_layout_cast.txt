Fix two critical codegen bugs:

1. DCE pass incorrectly removes Alloca instructions for unused function parameters.
   This causes find_param_alloca (which uses positional indexing) to map parameters
   to wrong stack slots, resulting in miscompilation of functions with (void)param casts.

2. get_pointed_struct_layout does not handle Expr::Cast or Expr::AddressOf expressions,
   causing offsetof() to always return 0 and struct member access through cast/addressof
   expressions (like (&lj)->b or ((struct S*)0)->field) to use offset 0.
