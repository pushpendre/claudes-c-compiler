Task: Fix dependency file generation in compile-and-link mode (run_full)

Problem: When compiling and linking in one step (without -c), the compiler does not
generate Make dependency files (.d files), even when -MD, -MMD, -MF, or -Wp,-MMD,<path>
flags are specified. This prevents the compiler from being used as HOSTCC in the Linux
kernel build, since the kernel expects the .d file to exist for fixdep to process.

Root cause: The run_full method in driver/driver.rs does not call write_dep_file(),
while run_preprocess_only, run_assembly_only, and run_object_only all do.

Fix: Add write_dep_file call in run_full for each compiled .c file, using the first
input file to derive the dependency target (matching GCC behavior).
