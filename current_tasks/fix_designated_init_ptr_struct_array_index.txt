Fix designated array initializer ignoring index when struct has pointer fields

Bug: When using designated array initializers like:
  struct WithPtr table[5] = { [2] = { "two", 2 }, [4] = { "four", 4 } };

If the struct has pointer fields (char *, function pointers, etc.), the array
index designator [N] is ignored and entries are placed sequentially at indices
0, 1, 2, ... instead of at the designated indices.

Structs WITHOUT pointer fields work correctly with designated array indices.
This suggests the bug is specifically in the pointer-field global init path
(global_init_compound.rs or similar) where it handles structs that contain
relocatable pointer values.

The previous fix (244a279) addressed [N].field designators but did not fix
plain [N] = { whole struct init } for structs with pointer fields.
