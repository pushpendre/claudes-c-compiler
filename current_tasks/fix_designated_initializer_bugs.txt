Fix designated initializer bugs

Issues being fixed:
1. Compound literals (e.g., (struct a){1,2}) not recognized as struct values
   in struct initialization, causing .a=(struct a){1,2} to fail
2. String literals in designated array init for global vars (e.g., .a[1]="abc")
   not written correctly to the global data section
3. String literals in designated array init for local vars similarly broken
4. Flat struct initializer array size calculation counting scalars instead of
   struct members (e.g., struct {int m; char ch;} x[] = {1,'b'} creating
   2-element array instead of 1-element)

These affect many compiler_suite_0030_*, 0031_*, 0032_* tests as well as
array-of-structs and designated-initializer tagged tests.
