Task: Fix div_by_const panic for large unsigned divisors
Status: in_progress
Started: 2026-01-27

Bug: compute_unsigned_magic_32 panicked with unreachable!() for divisors
close to u32::MAX (about 100 values near 2^32). The magic number algorithm
can't find valid 32-bit multipliers for these large divisors.

Fix: Return Option from compute_unsigned_magic_32, falling back to native
division for these rare cases.
