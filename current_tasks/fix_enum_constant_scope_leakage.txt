Task: Fix enum constant scope leakage in lowerer

Problem:
The lowerer pre-collects all enum constants from the entire AST into a flat
HashMap (self.enum_constants) before lowering any code. This means enum
constants declared in block scopes leak to other scopes, causing incorrect
name resolution when local variables share names with enum constants.

Example:
  int main() {
      { int a = 5; printf("%d", a); }  // Should print 5
      { enum { a, b }; }                // 'a' = 0 leaks
      { int a = 10; printf("%d", a); } // Should print 10
  }
  // Currently prints 0, 0, 0 instead of 5, 0, 10

Fix approach:
- Remove the global enum constant pre-collection pass
- Instead, track enum constants with scope awareness in the lowerer
- Use the lowerer's existing scope mechanism (or add one) to ensure
  enum constants only resolve within their declaring scope
- When a name lookup occurs, check local variables first, then
  enum constants visible in the current scope

This fixes multiple test failures including:
- compiler_suite_0149_0101 and similar ternary tests
- Various tests where local variable names conflict with enum constants
