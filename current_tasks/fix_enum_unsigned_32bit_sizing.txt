Task: Fix enum sizing for unsigned 32-bit values (e.g. 1U << 31)

Problem: Enums containing values like `1U << 31` (0x80000000) are incorrectly
sized as 8 bytes (64-bit) instead of 4 bytes (32-bit unsigned int).

This causes ABI mismatches in function calls on i686 where the caller pushes
the enum as 64-bit but the callee expects 32-bit, corrupting subsequent
arguments on the stack.

Affected project: capstone (fails on i686 due to cs_mode enum having 1U << 31)

Fix: Update packed_size() in types.rs to check u32 range for non-packed enums,
and update IrType::from_ctype to handle unsigned 4-byte enums correctly.

Status: in_progress
