Task: Fix x86 kernel miscompilation in fs/file.c

The delta debugging tool identified that fs/file.c compiled with our compiler
causes an x86 boot failure (timeout - kernel hangs during boot).

fs/file.c manages the file descriptor table. It implements alloc_fdtable,
expand_fdtable, dup_fd, and related fd operations. Miscompilation here would
affect process creation (fork/clone/exec) and file descriptor handling.

Status: in_progress
