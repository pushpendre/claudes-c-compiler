Task: Fix flexible array member (FAM) initialization in global structs
Status: DONE

Problem:
When a struct with a flexible array member (e.g., `struct one { int a; int values[]; }`)
is initialized globally (`struct one hobbit = {5, {1, 2, 3}}`), the FAM data is lost.
Only the non-FAM fields are emitted in the .data section.

Root causes:
1. `actual_alloc_size` uses `layout.size` which excludes the FAM (correct per C standard for sizeof)
2. `lower_struct_global_init` allocates byte buffer of `layout.size` only - too small for FAM data
3. `fill_struct_global_bytes` doesn't have a match arm for `CType::Array(_, None)` (FAM)

Fix:
1. Added `compute_fam_extra_size()` to calculate extra bytes needed for FAM init data
2. Enlarged byte buffer in `lower_struct_global_init` to include FAM data
3. Added `CType::Array(elem_ty, None)` match arm in `fill_struct_global_bytes` to write FAM elements
4. Updated `IrGlobal::size` to use actual init data size when it exceeds layout.size (for FAM)

Tested: Verified on all 3 backends (x86-64, AArch64, RISC-V) with both positional and designated initializers.
