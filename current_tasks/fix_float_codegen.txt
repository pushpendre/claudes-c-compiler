Fix floating-point codegen on x86-64

Float constants are not being emitted properly - they are replaced with
xorq %rax, %rax (zero). Float values need to:

1. Float/double constants emitted into .rodata with labels
2. Loaded via movss/movsd from .rodata into XMM registers
3. Float store/load uses movsd/movss instead of movq
4. Float function arguments passed via xmm0-xmm7 (SysV ABI)
5. %al set to number of FP args for variadic function calls
6. Float return values in xmm0

This affects thousands of tests that use any floating-point operations.
