Fix _Generic selection qualifier stripping for non-pointer types

Status: in_progress

Problem:
_Generic selection wrongly considers top-level qualifiers on the controlling
expression for non-pointer scalar types. Per C11 6.5.1.1p2, the controlling
expression undergoes lvalue conversion which strips top-level qualifiers.

Example:
  int const x = 0;
  _Generic(x, int: 10, int const: 100) // should be 10, we produce 100

The current code tracks is_const on local variables and uses it in _Generic
matching. But for non-pointer types, the controlling expression's const
should be ignored (lvalue conversion strips it).

Fix: In resolve_generic_selection, only use ctrl_is_const for pointer types
where is_const represents pointee constness (which survives lvalue conversion).
For non-pointer types, force ctrl_is_const to false.

Failing tests:
- compiler_suite_0005_0005 (all architectures)
