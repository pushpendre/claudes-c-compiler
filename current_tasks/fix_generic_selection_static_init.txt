Fix _Generic selection expressions in static/global initializers.

Problem: _Generic expressions used in global/static initializer context
produce zero/NULL values instead of the correctly selected expression.
This affects QEMU's TCG opcode table (all_outop array) which uses
_Generic in OUTOP macro for designated array initializers.

Root cause: eval_const_expr() and lower_global_init_expr() don't handle
Expr::GenericSelection - they fall through to zero initialization.

Fix: Resolve _Generic to its selected expression before evaluating in
const_eval and global_init paths.
