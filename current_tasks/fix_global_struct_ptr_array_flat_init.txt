Task: Fix global struct pointer array flat-init miscompilation
Status: IN PROGRESS

Problem:
Global struct initialization with pointer arrays (e.g., `char *s[2] = {"abc", "def"}`)
was miscompiled. String literal values were stored inline as bytes instead of as pointers
because the flat-init grouping logic unconditionally excluded string literals from flat-init
for ALL array types, when it should only exclude them for char arrays.

File: src/ir/lowering/global_init_compound.rs
Test case: compiler_suite_0030_0067 (segfault due to this bug)
