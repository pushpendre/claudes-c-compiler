Fix GNU89 extern inline emission semantics

In GNU89 mode (-std=c89, -fgnu89-inline), `extern inline` functions should
NOT emit a standalone global symbol. This matches GCC behavior and is required
by glibc headers (e.g., getchar, putchar, atoi from bits/stdio.h) which use
__extern_inline (= extern __inline without gnu_inline attribute in GNU89 mode).

Bug: The gnu89_inline flag was passed from the driver to the preprocessor to
define __GNUC_GNU_INLINE__ vs __GNUC_STDC_INLINE__, but was NOT passed to the
IR lowering stage. As a result, `extern inline` functions in C89 mode were
emitted as global symbols (C99 semantics) instead of being treated as inline-only.

Fix: Pass gnu89_inline flag through to the Lowerer and use it in three places:
1. lowering.rs: Main emission loop skip/emit decision
2. func_lowering.rs: Linkage (static vs global) determination
3. ref_collection.rs: Dead function elimination skippability check

Status: in_progress
