Fix goto label collisions across functions

The compiler generates `.Luser_{label_name}` for user-defined goto labels,
but this is not function-scoped. When multiple functions use the same label
name (e.g., `lab:`), the assembler reports "symbol is already defined".

This causes ~31 assembly failures in the test suite.

Fix:
1. In IR lowering, prepend function name or unique counter to user labels
   so that goto labels become `.Luser_{func}_{label}` or similar
2. This ensures labels are unique across the entire compilation unit

Additionally fixing: global struct initializer codegen
