Fix __alignof__ to return preferred alignment on i686
=====================================================
Status: in_progress

Problem:
GCC distinguishes between __alignof__ (preferred alignment) and _Alignof (minimum ABI alignment):
- __alignof__(long long) = 8 on i686 (preferred)
- _Alignof(long long) = 4 on i686 (minimum ABI)
- __alignof__(double) = 8 on i686 (preferred)
- _Alignof(double) = 4 on i686 (minimum ABI)

Our compiler currently expands __alignof/__alignof__ as macros to _Alignof,
so they both return 4. This causes test failures in compiler_suite_0077_0002.

Fix: Make __alignof/__alignof__ a separate token that returns preferred alignment,
keeping _Alignof as C11 standard minimum alignment.

Note: struct member alignment is still 4 (unchanged). Only the standalone
__alignof__ query changes.
