Fix i686 builtin assembler: symbol-difference displacement in memory operands

Problem: leal .Lstore_table-.Lpc1(%ebx, %ecx, 8), %ebx fails because
the parser treats ".Lstore_table-.Lpc1" as a single symbol name rather
than a symbol difference. The encoder then creates a relocation for a
non-existent symbol, resulting in displacement 0.

This breaks libffi's sysv.S PIC jump table on i686 (call_double and
call_void tests fail).

Fix:
1. Add SymbolDiff variant to Displacement enum in parser.rs
2. Update parse_displacement to detect sym-sym patterns
3. Handle SymbolDiff in i686 encoder (resolve to constant at assembly time)
4. May also need to add int3 instruction support for i686
