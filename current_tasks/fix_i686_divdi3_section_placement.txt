Task: Fix i686 __divdi3/__udivdi3/__moddi3/__umoddi3 section placement

Status: in_progress

Problem:
The i686 backend emits 64-bit division runtime helper stubs (__udivdi3,
__umoddi3, __divdi3, __moddi3) as weak symbols. However, these stubs are
emitted without an explicit .text section directive, so they inherit
whatever section was last active during code generation.

If the last function in a translation unit has a custom section attribute
(e.g., __attribute__((section(".init.text")))), the division helpers end
up in that section instead of .text.

This causes Linux kernel build failures: modpost detects section mismatches
because functions in .text call __udivdi3 in .init.text, which violates
the kernel's section rules (init code is discarded after boot).

Fix:
Add an explicit ".text" section directive in emit_runtime_stubs() before
emitting the division helper functions, ensuring they always go into .text
regardless of what section the last function was in.
