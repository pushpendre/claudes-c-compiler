Task: Fix i686 x87 floating-point subtraction and division operand order
Status: in_progress

Problem: On i686, x87 fsubp/fdivp instructions have reversed operand semantics
in GAS AT&T syntax compared to what you'd expect:
  fsubp  %st, %st(1) → st(1) = st(0) - st(1)  (reversed!)
  fsubrp %st, %st(1) → st(1) = st(1) - st(0)  (the expected order)

The compiler was loading lhs into st(1), rhs into st(0), then using fsubp/fdivp,
which computed rhs-lhs instead of lhs-rhs. Similarly for F32 SSE, the xmm
register assignments were swapped, producing rhs-lhs instead of lhs-rhs.

Fix: Use fsubrp/fdivrp for x87 (F64/F128) and swap xmm register assignments
for SSE (F32).

Expected impact: ~3% improvement in i686 test pass rate (72% → 75%).
