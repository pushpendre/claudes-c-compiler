Fix i686 global struct data emission with pointer-sized fields

GlobalInit::byte_size() and GlobalInit::emitted_byte_size() in ir/ir.rs
hardcode GlobalAddr/GlobalAddrOffset to 8 bytes. On i686 (32-bit), pointers
are 4 bytes. This causes:

1. .size directive inflated (e.g. 20 instead of 16 for struct with 2 ptrs + 2 ints)
2. append_nested_compound in global_init_compound_struct.rs skips fields after
   a GlobalAddr because it thinks 8 bytes were consumed when only 4 were
3. Structs with pointer members crash at runtime (SIGSEGV) due to misaligned/missing data

Fix: use target_ptr_size() instead of hardcoded 8 in byte_size()/emitted_byte_size().

Affected tests: anon-struct-designated-init, static-local-selfref-member-addr,
struct-member-array-decay-init, and likely many more from /clean_tests.
