Task: Fix i686 inline asm 64-bit register pair handling
Status: in_progress

Problem: On i686, inline asm constraints like "+r" with 64-bit (unsigned long long)
values only allocate a single 32-bit register, causing the high 32 bits to be lost.
This breaks xxhash's XXH_COMPILER_GUARD macro: __asm__("" : "+r" (val))

Fix: Implement register pair allocation for 64-bit inline asm operands on i686.
When a GP register constraint is used with an I64/U64 type, allocate two registers
(e.g., eax:edx), load both halves, and store both halves back.
