Task: Fix i686 va_start named parameter offset computation
Status: in_progress
Started: 2026-01-28

Problem:
emit_va_start on i686 always set va_list to 8(%ebp), ignoring the size of
named parameters. This caused variadic functions to read arguments from
the wrong stack location (overlapping with named parameters).

For example, `void foo(double i, ...)` has a named double (8 bytes) at
8(%ebp), so variadic args start at 16(%ebp), not 8(%ebp).

Fix:
1. Added total_stack_bytes field to ParamClassification to capture the
   final stack_offset from classify_params_full (the exact byte count
   of all named parameters).
2. Added va_named_stack_bytes field to I686Codegen, computed during
   calculate_stack_space for variadic functions.
3. Fixed emit_va_start to use leal (8 + va_named_stack_bytes)(%ebp)
   instead of hardcoded leal 8(%ebp).
