Fix sema to error on variable declarations with incomplete struct/union types

Problem:
The compiler silently accepts variable declarations with incomplete (forward-declared
but not defined) struct/union types, e.g.:
  struct nonexistent x;  // should error: storage size of 'x' isn't known

GCC/Clang correctly reject this with: error: storage size of 'x' isn't known

This causes runit to fail because the build system's feature detection (tryuwtmpx.c)
tries to declare `struct futmpx ut;` which should fail (struct futmpx doesn't exist
on Linux), falling back to utmp. But our compiler accepts it, selecting the wrong
header (uw_tmp.h2 instead of uw_tmp.h1), causing _UTMPX_FILE/_WTMPX_FILE undeclared errors.

Fix: Add a check in sema for variable declarations to verify the type is complete
(has known size) when declaring stack or file-scope variables.
