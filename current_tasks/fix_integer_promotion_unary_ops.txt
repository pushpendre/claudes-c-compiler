Task: Fix integer promotion for unary operators (-, ~, +)

Problem: Unary negation (-), bitwise complement (~), and unary plus (+) on types
narrower than int (char, unsigned char, short, unsigned short) do not apply C's
integer promotion rules. The result type should be at least int (I32), but
currently the result type inherits the sub-int operand type.

Example:
  unsigned char uc = 1;
  int neg = -uc;  // Should be -1, but compiler produces 255

The fix needs to:
1. Update infer_expr_type for UnaryOp to apply integer_promote
2. Update maybe_narrow in lower_unary_op to narrow to the promoted type (I32 minimum)
3. Update get_expr_type in types.rs for unary ops to return promoted type

This affects multiple test failures related to char/short arithmetic, comparisons,
and pointer arithmetic with char indices.
