Task: Fix long double stack alignment and function pointer dereference detection
Status: in progress

Two bugs fixed:

1. Long double stack argument alignment mismatch:
   - Callee-side (call_emit.rs) F128AlwaysStack offset calculation didn't align to 16 bytes,
     but caller-side padding (compute_stack_arg_padding) did, causing misaligned reads.
   - Fix: Add 16-byte alignment to callee offset calculation.

2. Function pointer returning pointer misidentified as pointer-to-function-pointer:
   - is_ptr_to_func_ptr in lowering.rs counted Pointer entries BEFORE FunctionPointer
     in derived declarators, but extra indirection pointers appear AFTER FunctionPointer.
   - For int *(*fnc)(): derived = [Pointer(ret), Pointer(syntax), FunctionPointer] - NOT ptr-to-fptr
   - For int (**fpp)(): derived = [Pointer(syntax), FunctionPointer, Pointer(extra)] - IS ptr-to-fptr
   - Fix: Check for Pointer entries AFTER FunctionPointer instead of before.

Also: emit_call_instruction's Deref arm now uses the comprehensive is_function_pointer_deref()
check instead of a limited inline check that missed ptr_sigs fallback.
