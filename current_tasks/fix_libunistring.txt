Fix libunistring compilation failure caused by preprocessor injecting
typedef __builtin_va_list va_list / __gnuc_va_list text at include
boundaries. The pending_injections get emitted in the middle of array
initializers when stdarg.h is included from a nested header.

Fix: remove the text injection of va_list/gnuc_va_list typedefs since
the parser and IR lowerer already handle these types natively.
