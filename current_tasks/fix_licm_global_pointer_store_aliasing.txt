Fix LICM: stores through pointers loaded from globals not tracked

Bug: LICM's `has_global_derived_stores` flag only tracks stores through
GlobalAddr-derived pointers (direct GlobalAddr or GEP from GlobalAddr),
but NOT stores through pointers that were loaded from global variables.

Example:
  struct S { char arr[8]; int j; } s;
  struct S *p = &s;
  for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
      p->j = p->j + p->arr[i];  // store through loaded pointer
  }

The store to p->j goes through: GlobalAddr @s -> Load -> GEP -> Store.
The `global_addr_values` set follows GlobalAddr -> GEP chains but stops
at Load instructions. So the store target is not in global_addr_values,
and has_global_derived_stores stays false. This causes LICM to incorrectly
determine that loads from globals can be hoisted past stores in the loop.

Fix: extend global_addr_values to also include GEPs whose base is a Load
from a global_addr_value, OR conservatively set has_global_derived_stores
when any store goes through a non-alloca, non-param pointer.

Status: in_progress
