Fix LICM pass: incorrect loop-invariant code hoisting

Problem:
The LICM (Loop-Invariant Code Motion) pass incorrectly hoists instructions
out of loops, producing wrong code. This causes postgres initdb to fail
with "invalid checkpoint record" / WAL corruption.

Diagnosis:
- postgres -O0: PASS
- postgres -O1: PASS (no LICM)
- postgres -O2 with LICM disabled: PASS
- postgres -O2 with LICM enabled: FAIL (even with 1 iteration)

The LICM pass is hoisting something that has side effects or depends on
loop-varying values. The bug is in src/passes/licm.rs.

Fix plan:
1. Read and understand the LICM pass
2. Create a minimal reproducer
3. Fix the invariant analysis to correctly handle the failing case
4. Verify postgres passes with the fix
