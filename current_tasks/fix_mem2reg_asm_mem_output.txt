Task: Fix mem2reg incorrectly promoting allocas used as =m inline asm outputs

Problem: When an alloca is used as an output operand with a memory-only
constraint like "=m", mem2reg promotes it to a fresh SSA value. This is
wrong because the inline asm writes directly to memory at the alloca's
stack address. After promotion, the backend no longer recognizes the value
as an alloca, uses movq (load value) instead of leaq (compute address),
and the inline asm writes to garbage memory.

Example failing test: asm-mov-save-restore-x86-004-run2
The "=m" output operands get promoted, and the backend loads uninitialized
stack values instead of computing the alloca addresses.

Fix: In mem2reg's InlineAsm handling, disqualify allocas used as output
pointers when the output constraint is memory-only (=m, =o, =V, =p).
These allocas must keep their stack slots for the inline asm to write to.

Status: in_progress
