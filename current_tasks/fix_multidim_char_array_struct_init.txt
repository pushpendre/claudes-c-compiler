Fix multi-dimensional char array initialization inside structs.

Bug: When a struct contains a multi-dimensional char array field
(e.g., char headers[13][2][2048]) and the struct is initialized with
string literal initializers, the char arrays are incorrectly left as
all zeros instead of being filled with the string contents.

Three code paths needed fixing:
1. fill_multidim_array_field: string literal Expr items for char arrays
2. fill_array_field_recursive: string literal in brace-wrapped char array init
3. fill_composite_or_array_with_ptrs: multi-dimensional array dispatch in compound path
4. emit_compound_field_init: multi-dimensional array in non-pointer compound path

Status: in_progress
