Fix multi-dimensional array access through struct members (e.g., s.arr[i][j]).
The compiler currently segfaults on 2D array member access in structs because
subscript_result_is_array and get_array_elem_size_for_subscript don't handle
MemberAccess as the root of a subscript chain, causing a load to be emitted
where only address arithmetic should happen.
