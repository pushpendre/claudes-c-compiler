Fix nested struct designated initializers in global/static array initializers.

Bug: When a global array uses designated initializers with nested struct fields
(e.g., .interface = { .init = stringInit }), the nested struct's members are
not correctly emitted - function pointers end up as NULL.

This causes Redis to crash on startup because the config initialization table
uses this pattern: each standardConfig entry has .interface = { .init = fn }
and the function pointer is lost, so initConfigValues() doesn't initialize
server.logfile, causing a NULL dereference in serverLogRaw.

Root cause is likely in ir/lowering/global_init.rs where compound initializers
for nested structs inside global arrays are processed.
