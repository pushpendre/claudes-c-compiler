Task: Fix Nix build setup for offline use
Status: in_progress (STOLEN - previous owner's work incomplete)

Problem: /verify/setup_nix.sh and subsequent nix build commands fail in the
offline container environment. The flake.lock was added but the full pipeline
may still have issues.

Solution: Ensure the complete pipeline works:
1. /verify/setup_nix.sh runs successfully
2. cd /workspace/nix-build && CCC_PATH=... nix build --impure .#cccPkgs.hello
Fix any remaining issues in the compiler or nix setup.
