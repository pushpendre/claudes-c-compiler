Task: Fix Nix build setup for offline use
Status: in_progress

Problem: /verify/setup_nix.sh fails because it creates a flake.nix without a
flake.lock, causing nix to try to fetch flake-utils and nixpkgs from the
internet (which is unavailable in this environment).

Solution: Add a flake.lock file to /verify/ that pins the inputs to the store
paths already available in /nix-template. Update setup_nix.sh to copy the
flake.lock alongside the flake.nix.
