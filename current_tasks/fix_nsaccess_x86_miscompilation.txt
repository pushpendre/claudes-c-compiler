Task: Fix drivers/acpi/acpica/nsaccess.c x86 miscompilation causing boot hang
Status: in_progress
Started: 2026-01-27

The delta debugging tool (seed=200) found that compiling drivers/acpi/acpica/nsaccess.c
with CCC causes the x86 kernel to hang during boot (223s timeout).

Plan:
1. Compare CCC vs GCC assembly output for nsaccess.c
2. Identify the miscompiled construct
3. Write minimal reproducer
4. Fix the compiler bug
5. Verify the fix with the DD tool
