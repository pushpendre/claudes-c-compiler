Fix: x86 codegen register clobbering in unsigned >= comparison

The unsigned >= comparison `to + 1 >= data[x*2]` in add_code_range_to_buf()
generates incorrect assembly. The register allocator loads data[x*2] into %eax
but then a subsequent load of to+1 from a stack slot overwrites %rax before the
comparison happens. The comparison ends up comparing to+1 against the byte offset
instead of the loaded data value.

This causes oniguruma's testcu (UTF-16 regex tests) to fail with 4 incorrect
results, because character class ranges are incorrectly merged during compilation.

Root cause: likely a register allocation or instruction selection bug where the
result of a memory load (array index expression) is not properly preserved when
both operands of a comparison are complex expressions that need temporary registers.
