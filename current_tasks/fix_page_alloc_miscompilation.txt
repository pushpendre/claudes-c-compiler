Task: Fix miscompilation of mm/page_alloc.c causing kernel boot failure
Status: in_progress
Started: 2026-01-26

The kernel file mm/page_alloc.c (page allocator) is miscompiled by ccc,
causing a boot failure. Delta debugging confirmed this single file causes
the failure. Need to identify root cause by comparing ccc and gcc output
and fix the compiler bug.
