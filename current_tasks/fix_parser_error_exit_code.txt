Fix parser errors to cause non-zero exit code

Problem:
- The parser prints errors via eprintln! but never tracks them
- The driver doesn't check for parser errors after parsing
- This causes compilation to succeed (exit 0) even when parse errors occur
- This breaks autoconf configure scripts which check exit codes to detect:
  - Byte ordering (bigendian check)
  - Undeclared functions
  - Missing struct members
  - Feature availability

Also adding implicit function declaration warnings so configure scripts
can detect undeclared functions (needed for PostgreSQL and other projects).

Fix:
1. Add error_count field to Parser struct
2. Increment on parse errors in expect(), expressions.rs, types.rs
3. Return error count from parse() or add method to check
4. Check in driver after parsing, return Err if errors > 0
5. Add warning for implicit function declarations in sema/lowering
