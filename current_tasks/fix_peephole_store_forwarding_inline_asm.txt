Task: Fix peephole store forwarding bug with inline asm rbp writes

Bug: The global_store_forwarding peephole pass does not invalidate slot
mappings when an unrecognized instruction (classified as LineKind::Other)
writes to a %rbp-relative stack slot. This causes inline asm instructions
like "movntil %ecx, -8(%rbp)" (from "=m" output constraints) to not
invalidate the stale store-forwarding mapping, leading to subsequent loads
being incorrectly eliminated as redundant.

Fix: In the LineKind::Other handler in global_store_forwarding(), when
infos[i].rbp_offset != RBP_OFFSET_NONE, invalidate the slot mapping for
that offset.

Status: in_progress
