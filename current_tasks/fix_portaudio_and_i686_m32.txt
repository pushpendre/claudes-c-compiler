Task: Fix PortAudio project build scripts and ccc-i686 -m32 handling
Status: in_progress

Issues found:
1. PortAudio check scripts are missing pa_test_harness.c (test file referenced but not included)
2. check_i686.sh passes -m32 to ccc-i686, which triggers GCC fallback unnecessarily
   since ccc-i686 is already a 32-bit compiler
3. Compiler fix: -m32 should be a no-op when target is already I686

Fix:
- Create pa_test_harness.c that tests Pa_Initialize/Pa_Terminate and ring buffer API
- Remove -m32 from check_i686.sh CMAKE_C_FLAGS
- Make -m32 a no-op in cli.rs when target is already I686
- Update new_projects.txt with PortAudio status
