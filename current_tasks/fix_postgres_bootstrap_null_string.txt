Fix PostgreSQL bootstrap NULL string argument crash

After fixing the typedef pointer array init and struct string literal init bugs,
postgres initdb's bootstrap phase now crashes with a different error:
pg_strtoint16_safe() receives a NULL string argument during BKI parsing.

The root cause is likely an uninitialized memory issue (confirmed by valgrind
producing no errors when zeroing memory). The NULL string comes from the
yacc parser value stack in bootparse.c, suggesting incorrect handling of
the YYSTYPE union or stack variable initialization by the compiler.

Debugging has shown the crash occurs in the boot_yyparse -> InsertOneValue
-> OidInputFunctionCall -> int2in -> pg_strtoint16_safe(NULL) path.
