Fix preprocessor rescan: object-like macro expanding to function-like macro name

When an object-like macro expands to text ending with a function-like macro name,
and the tokens following the expansion point include parenthesized arguments,
the rescan should combine these to invoke the function-like macro.

Example:
  #define c_default_cmp(x, y) (...)
  #define i_cmp -c_default_cmp
  i_cmp(a, b) => should expand to -(...)  but currently stops at -c_default_cmp(a, b)

This fixes the stc project which fails on all 4 architectures.
