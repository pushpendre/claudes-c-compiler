Fixing: -pthread flag does not define _REENTRANT preprocessor macro

Problem: When GCC/Clang are invoked with -pthread, they automatically define _REENTRANT=1.
Our compiler accepts -pthread but silently ignores it (no macro defined).
This breaks configure scripts that check for _REENTRANT (e.g., iperf3, and many others).

Fix: Add a pthread field to Driver struct, set it when -pthread is parsed,
and define _REENTRANT=1 in configure_preprocessor() when the flag is active.

Affected project: iperf3 (fails on all 4 architectures because configure can't detect pthreads)
