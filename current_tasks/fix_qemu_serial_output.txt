Fix QEMU serial console output miscompilation

The QEMU x86_64-softmmu binary compiles and links, and --version/-cpu help work,
but serial console output from the guest is not displayed. When running with
-nographic or -serial file:..., the guest kernel's serial output (console=ttyS0)
is never written to the output fd.

Goal: Identify and fix the miscompilation causing missing serial output.
