Fix preprocessor recursive self-inclusion blocking

Problem: The preprocessor completely blocks re-inclusion of files that are
already on the include stack (includes.rs lines 50-54). This prevents valid
C patterns like TCC's x86_64-gen.c which includes itself recursively via
tcc.h with TARGET_DEFS_ONLY defined.

The current code:
  if self.include_stack.contains(&resolved_path) {
      return Some(String::new());  // blocks completely
  }

This is wrong. The C standard allows re-including files that don't have
#pragma once. Only #pragma once should prevent re-inclusion. For recursion
protection, we should use a depth limit (like GCC's 200-level default).

Fix: Replace the absolute block with a depth-counted limit. Count how many
times the file appears on the include stack and only block if count exceeds
a limit (e.g., 200).

Impact: Unblocks TCC build (x86_64-gen.c self-includes via tcc.h).
May also fix other projects that use similar patterns.

Status: in progress
