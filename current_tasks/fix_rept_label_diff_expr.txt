Fix .rept directive count expression with backward label references.

When .rept count is an expression involving backward label differences
like (662b-661b)/4, the assembler fails to evaluate it because the
expression evaluator only handles numeric constants, not label references.
This causes .rept to repeat 0 times instead of the correct count.

This affects the Linux kernel's alternative_else_nop_endif macro which
uses: nops (662b-661b) / AARCH64_INSN_SIZE

The fix: track numeric label byte positions during .rept expansion
and substitute them into expressions before evaluation.

Affects ARM and RISC-V assemblers (both use .rept with label diffs).
x86 may also be affected.
