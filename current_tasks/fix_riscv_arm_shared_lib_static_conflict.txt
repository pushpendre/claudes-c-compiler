Task: Fix RISC-V and ARM shared library build failure (postgres regression)
Status: in_progress

Problem:
When building shared libraries (-shared) on RISC-V and ARM, the linker receives
both -static (from extra_args default) and -shared (from user args). This causes
the linker to use static CRT objects (crtbeginT.o) which contain absolute
relocations (R_RISCV_HI20, R_AARCH64_ADR_PREL_PG_HI21) that are incompatible
with shared objects.

Root cause:
In backend/common.rs link_with_args(), the code skips -no-pie/-pie for shared
builds but does NOT skip -static. The -static default exists because QEMU
user-mode emulation needs static binaries, but it must not be passed when
building .so files.

Fix:
Add -static to the list of flags skipped when is_shared is true in link_with_args().

Impact:
This fixes postgres build on RISC-V and ARM (was failing at shared library link step).
