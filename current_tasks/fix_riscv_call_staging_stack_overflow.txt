Fix RISC-V kernel stack overflow by replacing s-register call argument staging
with stack-based staging.

Currently, emit_call_reg_args uses s2-s6 as staging temporaries for calls with
>3 GP register arguments. These s-registers are callee-saved, meaning they must
be saved/restored in the prologue/epilogue, adding 8 bytes per register to the
frame. They also can't be used for register allocation when reserved for calls.

Fix: Replace s2-s6 staging with stack-based staging. After staging the first 3
GP args in t3/t4/t5, stage remaining args into temporary stack slots. Then move
all staged values to their target arg registers (a0-a7) before the call. This:
1. Eliminates the need to reserve s2-s6 for call staging
2. Makes all of s2-s6 available for register allocation
3. Reduces callee-saved register saves in prologue/epilogue
4. Reduces stack frame sizes across the kernel (average 128.9 -> ~100 bytes)

The RISC-V kernel currently crashes with stack overflow during networking
operations due to 2.27x average stack frame bloat vs GCC.
