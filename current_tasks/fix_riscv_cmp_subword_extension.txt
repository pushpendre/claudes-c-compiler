Task: Fix RISC-V emit_cmp_operand_load wrong sign/zero extension for I8/I16/U8/U16 types

Bug: The emit_cmp_operand_load function in the RISC-V backend applies the same
32-bit extension to all sub-64-bit types. For U8/U16, it uses slli/srli by 32
(zero-extends from 32 bits) instead of proper 8/16-bit zero-extension. For I8/I16,
it uses sext.w (sign-extends from 32 bits) instead of proper 8/16-bit sign-extension.

This affects integer comparisons and conditional branches for sub-word types,
which can be produced by the narrow optimization pass.

Fix: Use per-type sign/zero-extension matching the existing patterns in
sign_extend_riscv and IntWiden cast code.

Status: in_progress
