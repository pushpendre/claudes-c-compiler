Fix RISC-V assembler li pseudo-instruction encoding for 64-bit immediates.

Current bug: The li encoding for values that don't fit in 32 bits uses `ori` to add
lower bits after a 32-bit left shift. This is incorrect because `ori` sign-extends
its 12-bit immediate, which corrupts the upper bits when the immediate is negative.

Example: li t0, 0x123456789ABCDEF0 produces wrong machine code.

Fix: Implement the standard GCC/LLVM approach of decomposing 64-bit values into
a sequence of lui + addiw + slli + addi instructions with optimally-sized shifts.

Also fix: TlsGotHi20 relocation type incorrectly maps to 23 (same as PcrelHi20)
instead of the correct value 21 (R_RISCV_TLS_GOT_HI20).
