Task: Fix RISC-V calling convention: even-align register pairs for 2xXLEN-aligned structs

Problem: On RISC-V LP64D, when a struct with 16-byte alignment (e.g., containing
long double) is passed by value in integer registers, the ABI requires the register
pair to start at an even-numbered register (a0, a2, a4, a6). CCC does not perform
this alignment, so struct { long double f; } passed as vararg(0, s) goes to a1/a2
instead of a2/a3, causing the callee's va_arg to read incorrect data.

Fix: Added struct_arg_aligns to CallInfo and struct_align to IrParam. Both caller
(call_abi.rs) and callee (call_emit.rs) classification skip to even register when
align_i128_pairs && regs_needed == 2 && struct_align > slot_size.

Test results:
- RISC-V: 2849/2859 (99.7%) tests, all 12 projects PASS
- x86: 2990/2990 (100%), all projects PASS
- ARM: 2854/2868 (99.5%), 11/12 projects PASS (mbedtls fail pre-existing)
- i686: 2733/2737 (99.9%), all projects PASS
- Kernel: tinyconfig RISC-V builds and boots

Status: completed
