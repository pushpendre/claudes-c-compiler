Task: Fix x86 kernel miscompilation in kernel/sched/core.c

The delta debugging tool identified that kernel/sched/core.c compiled with our
compiler causes a boot failure. The kernel panics with a NULL pointer dereference
in count_open_files, called from dup_fd -> sane_fdtable_size during the first
kernel_clone in rest_init. The miscompilation in sched/core.c is causing
corrupted state that leads to this crash.

Status: in_progress
