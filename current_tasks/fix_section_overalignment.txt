Task: Fix section alignment promotion breaking kernel .init.setup
Status: in_progress
Agent: claude

Problem: The effective_align() function in backend/common.rs promoted alignment to 16
for any global with size >= 16, including globals placed in custom sections via
__attribute__((section("..."))). This caused the linker to insert 8 bytes of padding
in the kernel's .init.setup section (which contains tightly-packed 24-byte
obs_kernel_param structs), corrupting the early param parsing and causing a NULL
pointer dereference during boot (Page Fault in parameq called from do_early_param).

Root cause: effective_align() did not check whether the global had a custom section
attribute before promoting alignment. GCC respects explicit __aligned() attributes
to override its own alignment promotion, but our compiler's promotion in
effective_align() was applied after the explicit alignment was already resolved.

Fix: Skip the 16-byte alignment promotion for globals with custom section attributes
(g.section.is_some()). These globals should use their natural/explicit alignment only.
Also fixed a secondary bug: missing ptr_dir.align_arg() wrapper on line 461 (custom
section zero-init path).

Files modified:
- src/backend/common.rs (effective_align function + line 461 align_arg fix)

Test: tests/section-attr-no-overalign/main.c

Kernel bisect: init/calibrate.c and drivers/pcmcia/cs.c now pass (were failing
with boot hangs due to corrupted .init.setup section).
