Fix SQLite ARM window function OVER clause runtime parse error.

The compiled SQLite binary for ARM fails to parse SQL window functions like:
  SELECT id, amount, SUM(amount) OVER (ORDER BY id) as running FROM sales;
Produces: near "(": syntax error

This is a codegen correctness bug - the SQLite SQL parser is compiled
incorrectly for ARM, causing it to fail to recognize the OVER keyword
in window function syntax.
