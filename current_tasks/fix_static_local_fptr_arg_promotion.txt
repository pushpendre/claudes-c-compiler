Fix: Missing function pointer signature registration for static local function pointers

Problem: When a function pointer is declared as a static local variable
(e.g., `static float (*sfp)()`), the compiler does not register its
function pointer signature in func_meta.ptr_sigs. This causes calls
through static function pointers to not apply default argument promotions
(float->double for unprototyped function pointers).

Root cause: lower_local_static_decl in stmt.rs was missing the ptr_sigs
registration that the auto-local path had.

Fix: Add the same ptr_sigs registration loop to lower_local_static_decl.

Affects all architectures (frontend/IR issue).
