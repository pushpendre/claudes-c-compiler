Fix compiler: add support for reading from stdin ("-" as input filename)

The Linux kernel build system uses `as-instr` macros that pipe assembly through stdin:
    printf "%b\n" "$(instr)" | $(CC) -c -x assembler-with-cpp -o /dev/null -

Our compiler doesn't support "-" as an input filename (reading from stdin), causing
all assembler feature probes to fail. This means the kernel configures without
CONFIG_AS_HAS_INSN, CONFIG_AS_HAS_OPTION_ARCH, CONFIG_TOOLCHAIN_HAS_V, etc.

Fix: Accept "-" as an input filename and read from stdin in the driver pipeline.
