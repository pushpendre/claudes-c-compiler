Task: Fix struct assignment via pointer dereference producing zero-size memcpy

Problem:
struct_value_size() in expr_types.rs calls ctype.size() for Deref, ArraySubscript,
FunctionCall, Conditional, MemberAccess, and PointerMemberAccess expressions.
CType::size() returns 0 for Struct/Union types (since CType::Struct only stores
the name, not the layout). This causes lower_struct_assign to emit Memcpy with
size=0, making all struct copies through pointer dereference, array subscript,
function return, and conditional expressions produce zero-filled results.

Fix:
Replace ctype.size() with ctype.size_ctx(&self.types.struct_layouts) in
struct_value_size() so that struct/union sizes are properly resolved.

Impact: Fixes ~16+ test failures on x86 (struct-assignment, struct-passing,
struct-array tags), likely similar impact on ARM and RISC-V.
