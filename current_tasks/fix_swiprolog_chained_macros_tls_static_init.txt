Fix three compiler bugs discovered while investigating SWI-Prolog compilation:

1. Preprocessor: chained macro expansion across newlines
   - When a macro expansion produces a trailing function-like macro name,
     and the arguments '(' are on the next line, the preprocessor must
     accumulate lines to let the chained expansion work.
   - Pattern: STEP1(x) expands to "x STEP2", and STEP2(y) is on the next line.

2. x86-64 TLS: use Initial Exec model when -fPIC is enabled
   - Shared libraries need @GOTTPOFF (Initial Exec) instead of @TPOFF (Local Exec)
   - for thread-local variable access, or the linker rejects them.

3. Static initializer: handle &((&global)->field) as relocatable constant
   - When a struct initializer uses &((&global_struct)->field.member), the compiler
     must resolve this as GlobalAddrOffset("global_struct", offset).
   - Previously only handled &global.field (dot access), not -> (arrow through &).
