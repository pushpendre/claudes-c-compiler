Task: Fix #include resolution through symlinks to match GCC behavior

Status: in_progress

Problem: The preprocessor used std::fs::canonicalize when resolving #include "..."
paths, which follows symlinks. This meant that when a source file was accessed
through a symlink (common in build systems like exim), included headers were
searched relative to the symlink TARGET's directory instead of the symlink's
directory.

Example: If build-dir/local_scan.h -> ../src/local_scan.h includes "config.h",
our compiler searched in ../src/ (wrong), while GCC searches in build-dir/ (correct).

Fix: Replace canonicalize with make_absolute (absolute path without resolving
symlinks) in resolve_include_path, resolve_include_next_path, and set_filename.
Keep canonicalize only for comparison operations (include_next same-file detection).

This fixes exim compilation with ccc-i686 (and all architectures).
