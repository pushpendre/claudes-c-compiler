Task: Raise tiny inline threshold to cover guard-pattern functions
Status: in_progress
Started: 2026-01-27

Problem:
  Static inline functions with simple control flow (e.g., `if (flag) call()`)
  have ~9-15 IR instructions and 2-3 basic blocks. The previous "tiny" threshold
  (<=5 instructions, <=1 block) was too restrictive and didn't cover these
  guard-pattern functions.

  When the caller exceeds MAX_CALLER_INSTRUCTIONS_AFTER_INLINE (200), these
  small functions are not inlined, leaving standalone definitions that reference
  undefined symbols in dead code paths. This causes linker errors like:
    undefined reference to `__fscache_clear_page_bits'
  in fs/netfs/buffered_write.c (kernel x86 build, CONFIG_FSCACHE disabled).

Fix:
  Raised MAX_TINY_INLINE_INSTRUCTIONS from 5 to 15.
  Added MAX_TINY_INLINE_BLOCKS = 4 (was hardcoded to 1).
  This covers guard-pattern static inline functions that have an if/else
  and one or two calls, ensuring they're always inlined regardless of
  caller size.

different approach - this PR addresses it by raising the tiny threshold)
