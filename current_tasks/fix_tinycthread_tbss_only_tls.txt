Fix tinycthread: x86 and ARM linkers missing PT_TLS for .tbss-only TLS

When a program uses _Thread_local variables that are zero-initialized (going into .tbss
rather than .tdata), the x86 and ARM linkers fail to emit a PT_TLS program header.
This causes segfaults during thread exit in glibc's RPC thread cleanup.

Fix: Set tls_addr to the current file offset when only .tbss sections exist,
so that PT_TLS is correctly emitted even without .tdata.
