Fix typedef function pointer return type signedness

Bug: When calling through a function pointer declared via typedef (e.g.,
typedef int (*cmp_fn)(const void *, const void *)), the return type's
signedness is lost. The (*) syntax marker in the derived declarators was
incorrectly treated as a pointer return type, causing the return CType
to be Pointer(Int) instead of Int. This made the compiler classify the
call result as a pointer, forcing unsigned comparison instructions (seta
instead of setg), which broke signed comparisons like `fn(a, b) > 0`.

This caused PostgreSQL's initdb to PANIC with "could not open critical
system index 2672" because qsort comparators through typedef'd function
pointer types produced wrong sort ordering.

Fix: In stmt.rs and lowering.rs, the loop that builds FunctionTypedefInfo's
return_type from DerivedDeclarator::Pointer entries before FunctionPointer
now correctly excludes the last Pointer (the (*) syntax marker) rather
than including it as part of the return type.
