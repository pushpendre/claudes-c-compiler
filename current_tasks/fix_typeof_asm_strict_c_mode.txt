Task: Treat typeof/asm as identifiers in strict C standard mode (-std=c99, etc.)

Problem: The compiler treats bare `typeof` and `asm` as keywords even when
-std=c99 or -std=c11 is specified. In strict ISO C mode, these should be
regular identifiers. Only the __typeof__/__asm__ forms are always keywords.

This prevents compiling projects like scc (a C compiler) which defines a
function named `typeof` and builds with -std=c99.

Fix:
- Parse -std= flag in driver to detect strict C vs GNU dialect mode
- Thread gnu_extensions flag through to lexer
- Make bare typeof/asm conditional on gnu_extensions in keyword recognition
- __typeof__/__asm__ forms always recognized as keywords

Unblocks: scc (passes all 4 architectures)

Status: in_progress
