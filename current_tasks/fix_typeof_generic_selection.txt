Task: Fix typeof(_Generic(...)) returning wrong type
Status: in_progress
Agent: claude

Problem: typeof() on a _Generic expression always resolved to CType::Int (the fallback)
instead of the type of the selected association expression. This caused the Linux kernel's
READ_ONCE() macro (which uses _Generic + typeof for volatile pointer access) to truncate
64-bit pointers to 32-bit ints, causing boot failures.

Root cause: get_expr_ctype_lowerer in expr_types.rs had no handler for Expr::GenericSelection,
falling through to `_ => None`. The None propagated up to resolve_typeof which defaulted
to TypeSpecifier::Int.

Fix: Added resolve_generic_selection_ctype method to resolve the CType of the selected
_Generic association, and added Expr::GenericSelection arm to get_expr_ctype_lowerer.

Files modified:
- src/ir/lowering/expr_types.rs

Kernel bisect: net/core/fib_notifier.c and fs/proc/generic.c now pass (were failing
with boot hangs due to truncated list_head pointers in list_for_each_entry_rcu loops).
