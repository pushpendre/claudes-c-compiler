Lock: fix_unary_intrinsic_arg_widening (in_progress)

Bug: __builtin_clzll/__builtin_ctzll/__builtin_popcountll produce wrong results on i686
when the argument is narrower than 64 bits (e.g. size_t = 32-bit unsigned int).

lower_unary_intrinsic() in expr_builtins_intrin.rs lowers the argument with lower_expr()
but doesn't cast/zero-extend it to the intrinsic's operand width (I64 for "ll" suffix).
On i686, the backend's emit_load_acc_pair reads 8 bytes from a 4-byte stack slot,
picking up garbage in the high 32 bits (edx), causing wrong CLZ/CTZ/popcount results.

Fix: Use lower_expr_with_type() instead of lower_expr() to insert an implicit cast
from the argument's actual type to the intrinsic's expected operand type.

Affects: sort.h project (FPE in merge sort from wrong rbnd() result), likely others.
Status: in_progress
