Task: Make undeclared variable identifiers a hard error instead of a warning

Problem: Our compiler treats undeclared variable identifiers as warnings (exit code 0)
instead of errors (exit code non-zero). In standard C, using an undeclared variable
is always a hard error. Only implicit function declarations were warnings in C89.

This breaks autoconf-style configure scripts that test for features by checking if
code compiles successfully. For example, mksh's Build.sh tests whether RSIZE_MAX is
available by compiling code that uses it. Our compiler says "yes" because it exits 0
with just a warning, but then the actual build fails at link time with undefined
references to RSIZE_MAX.

Fix: In sema.rs, change the undeclared identifier handling to emit an error instead
of a warning. Keep WarningKind::Undeclared for the flag, but make it a hard error
by default. This matches GCC/Clang behavior.

Impact: Fixes mksh project and likely other projects with configure scripts.

Status: in_progress
