Fix va_arg with complex types (_Complex float/double/long double)

Problem:
- va_arg(ap, double _Complex) segfaults on ARM and produces wrong output on x86
- Complex types map to IrType::Ptr in the IR, so the backend treats them as
  integer/pointer types, loading only 8 bytes from the GP register area
- For complex types, we actually need two floating-point component values

Fix approach:
- In lower_va_arg, detect when the requested type is a complex type
- Decompose into two va_arg instructions for the component type (F32, F64, or F128)
- Allocate stack space and store both components, returning the alloca pointer
- This matches how complex types are decomposed for regular function calls
