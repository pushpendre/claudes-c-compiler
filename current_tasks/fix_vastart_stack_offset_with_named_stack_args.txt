Fix va_start stack pointer calculation when variadic functions have named parameters
that overflow to the stack (e.g., when long double args consume GP/FP register slots
and later int/float args spill to the stack).

Affected backends: ARM64 and RISC-V

ARM64 bug: va_named_stack_gp_count only counts GP register overflow, but misses
StackScalar and F128Stack named params. The __stack field in va_list points to the
wrong location.

RISC-V bug: va_start offset = va_named_gp_count * 8 doesn't account for stack-passed
named args (F128Stack, StackScalar beyond 8 GP regs). The va_list pointer is wrong.

Failing tests: gcc_torture_pr44942, compiler_suite_0172_0027, compiler_suite_0172_0032,
and other variadic tests with long double parameters.
