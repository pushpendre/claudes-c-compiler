Fix vector-to-scalar and scalar-to-vector cast codegen
=======================================================
Status: in_progress

Problem:
Casting from a vector type (e.g., `(long long)(V2SI){2,2}`) returns the
alloca stack pointer instead of loading the vector data as the scalar value.
This is because vectors are represented as IrType::Ptr (pointer to stack slot),
and the noop check in lower_cast treats vector-ptr-to-integer the same as a
regular pointer-to-integer cast.

Similarly, casting from scalar to vector (e.g., `(V2SI)(long long)val`) needs
to store the scalar value into the vector's alloca.

Affected tests (x86): gcc_torture_20050316_1, 20050316_2, 20050316_3, and others
Affected tests (all arches): vector type related tests

Fix location: src/ir/lowering/expr_access.rs, lower_cast() function
