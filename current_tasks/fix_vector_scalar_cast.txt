Fix vector-to-scalar and scalar-to-vector cast codegen
=======================================================
Status: completed

Problem:
Casting from a vector type (e.g., `(long long)(V2SI){2,2}`) returns the
alloca stack pointer instead of loading the vector data as the scalar value.
This is because vectors are represented as IrType::Ptr (pointer to stack slot),
and the noop check in lower_cast treats vector-ptr-to-integer the same as a
regular pointer-to-integer cast.

Similarly, casting from scalar to vector (e.g., `(V2SI)(long long)val`) needs
to store the scalar value into the vector's alloca.

Additionally, vector parameters were being passed incorrectly: the caller
emitted `leaq` (address of alloca) instead of loading the data, because
vectors were not classified as struct-like aggregates for call ABI purposes.

Fix locations:
- src/ir/lowering/expr_access.rs: vector cast handling in lower_cast()
- src/ir/lowering/func_lowering.rs: classify vector params as struct-like
- src/ir/lowering/expr_calls.rs: vector call arg size classification
- src/ir/lowering/lowering.rs: vector param_struct_sizes registration
- src/ir/lowering/stmt_init.rs: vector param_struct_sizes registration

Verification: All x86/ARM/RISC-V test suites pass with no regressions.
Kernel builds and boots successfully.
