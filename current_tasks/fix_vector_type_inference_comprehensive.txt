Fix vector type inference for binop and compound assign (comprehensive)

Combines fix_vector_binop_type_inference and fix_vector_compound_assign_type_inference.

Bug: When a binary operation involves a vector and a scalar (e.g., float4 * float),
usual_arithmetic_conversion returns the scalar type instead of the vector type.
This causes compound assignments like `a += b * s` to produce garbage results.

Root cause: usual_arithmetic_conversion, get_binop_ctype, infer_binop_ctype, and
expr_ctype don't handle CType::Vector.

Fix: Add vector type handling in usual_arithmetic_conversion and expr_ctype so that
when either operand is a vector, the result type is the vector type.

Status: in_progress
