Task: Fix miscompilation of mm/vmalloc.c causing kernel boot failure
Status: in_progress
Started: 2026-01-26

The kernel file mm/vmalloc.c is miscompiled by ccc, causing the kernel to fail to boot.
This file handles virtual memory allocation (vmalloc/vfree) which is critical for
kernel operation. The bisect tool reliably identifies this file as the cause of boot failure.

Plan:
1. Compare ccc output with GCC output for vmalloc.c to find differences
2. Isolate the specific function/construct causing the miscompilation
3. Create a minimal test case reproducing the bug
4. Fix the compiler bug
5. Verify the fix with the bisect tool
