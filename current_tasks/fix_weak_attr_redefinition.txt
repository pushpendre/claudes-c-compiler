Task: Fix __weak attribute lost on global variable redefinition with initializer
Status: in_progress

Problem: When a global variable is first declared with __attribute__((weak)) and
then redefined with an initializer (without __weak) in the same translation unit,
the compiler loses the weak binding and emits the symbol as GLOBAL instead of WEAK.

Example (Linux kernel init/version.c):
  const char linux_banner[] __weak;          // weak tentative definition
  const char linux_banner[] = "Linux...";    // strong definition (from #include)

GCC preserves the WEAK binding. Our compiler was emitting GLOBAL, causing a
"multiple definition" link error when version-timestamp.o also defines linux_banner.

Fix: In lower_global_decl, when replacing a tentative definition with an initialized
one, preserve the is_weak flag from the previous definition. Also handle the reverse
case where a later tentative redeclaration adds __weak to an already-emitted global.
