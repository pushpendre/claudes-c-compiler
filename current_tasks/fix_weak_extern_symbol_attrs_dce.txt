Fix: DCE pass incorrectly drops .weak directives for extern declarations

The dead-code elimination pass in passes/mod.rs filters symbol_attrs (which
contain .weak and .hidden assembler directives for extern declarations) using
a reachability set. However, extern-only symbols (symbols referenced but not
defined in the current TU) were not being tracked in the reachability graph's
name_to_id map, so they were always filtered out.

This caused linker errors for kernel files like kernel/vmcore_info.c that use
extern __weak declarations (e.g., kallsyms_names, kallsyms_token_table).

Fix: Don't filter symbol_attrs by reachability at all. These are purely
declarative assembler directives for extern symbols — emitting them for
unreferenced symbols is harmless, but dropping them causes linker failures.

Status: in_progress
