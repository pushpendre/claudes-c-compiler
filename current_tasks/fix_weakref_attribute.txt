Task: Implement __attribute__((weakref("target"))) support

Status: in_progress

Problem:
The __attribute__((weakref("target"))) attribute is completely unimplemented.
The parser silently ignores it, causing the declared variable to be emitted as
a separate zero-initialized static variable instead of being a weak alias for
the specified target.

This causes test compiler_suite_0059_0087 to fail on all architectures.
The weakref attribute is semantically equivalent to weak + alias("target").

Fix:
1. Add "weakref" / "__weakref__" recognition in parser.rs attribute parsing
2. When encountered, set both parsing_weak = true and parsing_alias_target
3. The rest of the pipeline (IR lowering + backend emission) already handles
   weak + alias combinations correctly.
