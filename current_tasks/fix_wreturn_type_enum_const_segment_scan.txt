Fix -Wreturn-type: enum constant eval in while(true) and segment scanning past null statements

Two remaining -Wreturn-type false positives blocking the Linux kernel build:

1. Enum constant evaluation in try_eval_constant_bool()
   - Linux kernel defines true/false as enum constants: enum { false = 0, true = 1 };
   - while(true) is not recognized as an infinite loop because try_eval_constant_bool
     only handles integer literals, not enum constant identifiers
   - Fix: Look up Expr::Identifier names in the enum_constants table
   - Affected files: interval_tree.c (4 errors), xz_dec_stream.c (1 error),
     zstd_decompress.c (1 error), zstd_decompress_block.c (2 errors), workqueue.c (1 error)

2. Switch segment outcome scanning past trailing null statements
   - Investigation showed this was NOT needed: all errors were caused by (1) above.
   - The existing forward-scanning logic in segment_outcome() already handles the
     do-while pattern correctly.

Results:
   - Enum constant fix resolves ALL 9 remaining -Wreturn-type errors in kernel build
   - Another agent (fix_switch_exhaustiveness_wreturn_type) also implemented the same
     sema.rs fix; our commit provides additional regression tests
   - 311/312 unit tests pass (1 pre-existing RISC-V failure)
   - 824/850 integration tests pass (26 pre-existing arch-specific failures, 0 regressions)
