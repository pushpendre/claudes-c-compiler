Fix x86 assembler: handle parenthesized register in inl/inb/inw instructions.

The x86 assembler's encode_in function doesn't handle the parenthesized register form
like `inl (%dx), %eax`. The `(%dx)` gets parsed as a Memory operand with base=dx and
offset=0, but encode_in only matches Register and Immediate operand forms. Need to add
a match arm that recognizes a Memory operand with a base register and zero offset as
equivalent to the bare register form for in/inb/inw/inl instructions.
