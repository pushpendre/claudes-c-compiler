Fix x86 builtin assembler: add suffix aliases and missing instructions for project builds.

The x86 builtin assembler fails on many projects when run with MY_ASM=builtin because:
1. jmpq/callq not recognized (should map to jmp/call) - blocks lua, jq, etc.
2. mov/cmp/add/sub without size suffix not handled (inline asm) - blocks mbedtls
3. cpuid, stc, rdtsc, syscall, etc. not implemented - blocks mbedtls, libsodium
4. rep without following string op (rep; ret pattern) - blocks libuv
5. Various string ops (movsq, stosq, etc.) missing
6. Various other missing instructions needed for project builds
