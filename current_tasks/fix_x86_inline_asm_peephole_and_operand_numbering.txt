Fix 3 failing x86 inline asm tests:

1. Peephole optimizer incorrectly eliminates loads from mm/xmm registers.
   register_family_fast() returns REG_NONE for mm0..mm7 and xmm0..xmm15,
   causing adjacent store/load elimination to treat different MMX/XMM registers
   as identical (REG_NONE == REG_NONE). Fix: add mm/xmm families to the
   register classifier, and guard REG_NONE comparisons.

2. XMM scratch allocator doesn't skip clobbered XMM registers.
   assign_scratch_reg for FpReg just increments asm_xmm_scratch_idx without
   checking the excluded list, so clobbered xmm registers can be assigned to
   operands, causing value corruption.

3. GCC operand numbering doesn't include synthetic "+" inputs at higher indices.
   When "+" outputs create matching inputs, GCC numbers them AFTER explicit
   inputs, but our gcc_to_internal mapping omits them entirely.

Tests affected:
- asm-adcl-x86-001g-run2 (ADC carry chain, issue #3)
- asm-movq-mmx-x86-003-run2 (MMX movq, issue #1)
- asm-pxor-x86-001c-run2 (PXOR double XOR, issue #2)

Status: in_progress
