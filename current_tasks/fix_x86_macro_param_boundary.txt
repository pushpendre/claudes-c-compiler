Fix GAS macro parameter substitution boundary checking in x86 assembler.

Problem: \orig was matching as prefix of \orig_len in .macro expansion,
causing altinstr_entry parameters to produce broken symbol names like
"140b_len" and "143f_len" instead of properly expanding to "142b-140b"
and "144f-143f".

Fix: Use replace_macro_param() which checks that the character after
\param is not an identifier continuation character (alphanumeric or _).
