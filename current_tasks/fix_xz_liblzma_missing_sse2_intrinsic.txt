Task: Add missing _mm_cvtsi64_si128 SSE2 intrinsic to emmintrin.h

Status: completed

Description:
- xz_liblzma CRC32/CRC64 fast path uses _mm_cvtsi64_si128 (convert 64-bit int to __m128i)
- This intrinsic was missing from our emmintrin.h, causing undefined reference linker errors
- Fix: added _mm_cvtsi64_si128 and _mm_cvtsi64x_si128 alias using _mm_set_epi64x(0, __a)
- Also cleaned up duplicate _mm_set_epi64x definition in emmintrin.h
- Added regression test: tests/sse2-cvtsi64-si128
- Updated new_projects.txt with test results for: giflib, libevent
- Note: xz_liblzma itself still has a separate runtime segfault in lzma_decode at -O2
  (related to __OPTIMIZE__ glibc inline wrappers, pre-existing optimization bug, deferred)
