Task: Implement designated initializer support
Status: In Progress

Problem:
- Designated initializers (.field = val for structs, [idx] = val for arrays) are parsed
  into the AST (Designator::Field, Designator::Index) but ignored during IR lowering
- Global struct initializers (lower_struct_global_init) iterate items sequentially,
  ignoring .field designators, so {.b = 2, .a = 1} assigns wrong values
- Local struct initializers in stmt.rs iterate by enumerate index, not by designator
- Array designated initializers ([2] = 5) are not supported in either local or global context
- Compound literals with struct type don't handle designators either

Fix:
- In lower_struct_global_init: look up field index from designator name in struct layout
- In local struct init (stmt.rs): same - use designator to determine field target
- In array init: use designator index to determine target element position
- Zero-initialize first, then fill designated positions
- Support mixed designated/positional initializers (positional continues from last position)
