Implement #include_next preprocessor directive

The #include_next directive searches for the included file starting from the
directory AFTER the directory where the current file was found, skipping the
current directory. This is a GCC extension used by glibc and other system headers.

Implementation approach:
1. Track the current file's directory in the preprocessor state
2. When #include_next is encountered, find the current file's position in the
   include path list and start searching from the next directory
3. Handle both #include_next <file> and #include_next "file" forms
