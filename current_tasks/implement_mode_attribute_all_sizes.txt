Implement __attribute__((mode(QI/HI/SI/DI))) for integer type sizes.

Currently only TI (128-bit) mode is handled. libffi uses DI mode to define
UINT64/SINT64 types, and the missing mode support causes struct layout mismatches
between C code and hand-written assembly, crashing all libffi tests.

Fix: extend the parser's mode attribute handling to support QI (8-bit),
HI (16-bit), SI (32-bit), and DI (64-bit) modes.
