Implement optimization level differentiation (-O0 through -O3, -Os, -Oz)
=========================================================================
Started: 2026-02-05

Currently all optimization levels run the identical pipeline. This task
implements proper per-level pass selection:

- -O0: mem2reg + constant_fold only (fast debug builds)
- -O1: core passes (cfg_simplify, copy_prop, dce, constant_fold, simplify, narrow)
- -O2: full pipeline (current behavior)
- -O3: full pipeline + aggressive inlining thresholds
- -Os/-Oz: full pipeline with size-oriented settings

Changes:
1. CLI: pass actual opt_level (0/1/2/3) to the pipeline
2. passes/mod.rs: select pass subsets based on opt_level
3. inline: respect opt_level for inlining thresholds
