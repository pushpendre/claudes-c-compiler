Implement -fpatchable-function-entry=N,M support

The kernel uses -fpatchable-function-entry=16,16 which requires:
1. Emitting M NOP bytes before the function entry point
2. Emitting N-M NOP bytes after (currently N==M so 0 after)
3. Emitting __patchable_function_entries section with pointers to the NOP areas
4. Parsing the CLI flag

Without this, kernel boot hangs because ftrace/static call patching cannot work.
This causes boot FAILs for many kernel files (e.g., tbinstal.c, ttm_execbuf_util.c, ohci-pci.c).
