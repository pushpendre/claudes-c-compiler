Task: Implement #pragma pack support

Goal: Support #pragma pack(N), pack(push,N), pack(pop), pack() directives
to control struct field alignment.

Currently #pragma pack is completely ignored by the preprocessor, so all
struct layouts use natural alignment. This causes 75%+ failure rate on
pragma-pack related tests.

Plan:
1. Add PragmaPack token variant to the lexer
2. Have preprocessor emit synthetic __ccc_pragma_pack directives in output
3. Parser maintains a pragma pack stack and applies max_field_align to structs
4. Pass max_field_align through AST to sema and lowering

Status: in progress
