Implement #pragma weak support for weak symbols and weak aliases.

Two forms:
  #pragma weak symbol           - mark symbol as weak
  #pragma weak symbol = alias   - create weak alias (symbol -> alias)

Implementation:
1. Parse #pragma weak in preprocessor, emit synthetic tokens for parser
2. Store weak aliases in IR module
3. Emit .weak and .set directives in backend

This should fix ~10 tests that use #pragma weak.
