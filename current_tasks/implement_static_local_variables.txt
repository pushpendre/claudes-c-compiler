Implement static local variable support

Static local variables are declared inside functions but have static storage
duration (persist across function calls, initialized once).

Implementation:
1. Add is_static field to Declaration in ast.rs
2. Track 'static' storage class specifier in parser
3. In lowering, emit static locals as global variables with mangled names
   (e.g., func.varname or __static_func_varname) to ensure uniqueness
4. Static locals should be zero-initialized if no explicit initializer
5. Update all three backends to handle static local globals correctly
