Implement proper typedef name tracking in the parser.

Currently the parser has a `typedefs` vector and checks it in `is_type_specifier`,
but it never actually records typedef names when parsing typedef declarations.

This causes cast expressions like `(test_t)x` to fail when `test_t` is a typedef'd type.

Tasks:
- Track whether parse_type_specifier encountered a `typedef` keyword
- When parsing declarations with typedef, add declared names to self.typedefs
- This will fix cast expressions using typedef names
- Also fix local typedef declarations in function bodies
