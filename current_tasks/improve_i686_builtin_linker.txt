Task: Improve i686 builtin linker (MY_LD=builtin)

Fixing multiple bugs in the i686 native ELF32 linker:
1. -l flag handling to search for static archives (.a) when no shared library (.so) is found
2. GNU version symbol handling for non-GLIBC libraries (e.g., libz, libpthread)
3. Shared library search to handle .so.N variants (not just .so.6)
4. Support for -l:filename syntax (exact filename library search)

These fixes enable the builtin linker to correctly link projects like
libpng, libuv, libffi, and musl.
