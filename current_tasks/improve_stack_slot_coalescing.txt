Improve stack slot coalescing for large switch-heavy functions
=============================================================

Problem: base_yyparse in postgres generates 28.9MB stack frame (vs GCC's 3KB)
because 3.6M IR values are classified as "multi-block" and each gets a
permanent 8-byte stack slot. The current coalescing only merges values
from the same basic block.

Fix: Implement dominator-tree-based sibling coalescing. Values from blocks
that share the same immediate dominator (and thus represent mutually exclusive
execution paths like switch cases) can share stack space.

This directly fixes the postgres initdb segfault caused by stack overflow
in base_yyparse.
