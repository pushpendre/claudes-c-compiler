Task: Intern struct/union layout key strings in CType for faster cloning

PROBLEM:
Profiling SQLite compilation shows ~14% of time in malloc/free, with CType::clone
being a major driver. The Struct(String) and Union(String) variants allocate a new
heap String on every clone. These are the most commonly cloned compound types.

APPROACH:
Replace CType::Struct(String) and CType::Union(String) with
CType::Struct(Rc<str>) and CType::Union(Rc<str>). Rc<str> cloning is a
single reference count increment (essentially free) vs deep String cloning.

Also convert EnumType.name and EnumType.variants to use Rc<str> where beneficial.

SCOPE:
- Change CType enum variants to use Rc<str>
- Update all creation sites (~7 across sema, type_checker, const_eval, lowering)
- Update all consumption sites (~80+ across 18 files)
- Most consumption sites use &str references so they just need .as_ref() or &*
- format!() key construction sites need .into() or Rc::from()

EXPECTED IMPACT:
Significant reduction in malloc/free overhead for struct/union-heavy code like SQLite.
