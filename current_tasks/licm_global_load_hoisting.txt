Task: Enhance LICM to hoist loads from global variables out of loops
Status: in_progress

Description:
The LICM pass currently only hoists loads from non-address-taken allocas.
Loads from GlobalAddr pointers (global variables) are never hoisted because
is_load_hoistable returns false for non-alloca pointers.

This is a significant performance bottleneck in tight rendering loops like
DOOM's R_DrawColumn, where loop-invariant globals like dc_source and
dc_colormap are re-read from memory every iteration.

The fix adds support for hoisting loads from GlobalAddr-defined pointers
when the loop body contains no function calls and no stores to the same
global address. This is safe because:
1. GlobalAddr pointers are always loop-invariant (they're compile-time constants)
2. If no store in the loop writes to that global and no call could modify it,
   the value cannot change during loop execution.

Expected impact: ~30% code size reduction in tight inner loops,
measurable DOOM rendering performance improvement.
