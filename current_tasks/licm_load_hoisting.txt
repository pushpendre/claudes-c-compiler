Task: LICM Load Hoisting for Loop-Invariant Loads
==================================================

Currently, LICM only hoists pure instructions (BinOp, UnaryOp, Cmp, Cast, GEP, Copy).
Loads are never hoisted, even when they load from addresses that are never modified
inside the loop (e.g., parameter allocas).

This causes severe performance degradation in loops that access function parameters
or other loop-invariant memory locations - each access re-loads from the stack slot
every iteration instead of keeping the value in a register.

Plan:
1. Extend LICM to identify loads that are safe to hoist:
   - Load from an alloca whose address is loop-invariant
   - The alloca is not stored to anywhere within the loop body
   - The loop body contains no calls (which could alias the alloca)
   OR: The alloca is never address-taken, so no call could modify it
2. Hoist such loads to the loop preheader block
3. Replace uses of the hoisted load's result within the loop

Expected impact: Major improvement on loops accessing function parameters
(array_sum, matrix multiply, etc.) - up to 6-12x speedup on tight loops.
