Optimize ARM and RISC-V GEP constant offset codegen

Problem:
- The ARM and RISC-V backends use the default trait fallback for GEP with constant offsets
- The default path does: load base to secondary, load constant offset to acc, add regs
- This generates 3+ instructions when it could use immediate-add patterns
- Both backends already have emit_add_imm_to_acc() that uses addi/add #imm efficiently
- But the GEP constant-offset path doesn't call it

Fix:
- Override emit_gep_direct_const, emit_gep_indirect_const, emit_gep_add_const_to_acc
  in both ARM and RISC-V backends
- ARM: use add Xd, Xn, #imm (0..4095) or sub Xd, Xn, #imm for small offsets
- RISC-V: use addi rd, rs, imm (-2048..2047) for small offsets
- Fall back to load-imm + add for large offsets
- This reduces code size and improves runtime performance for struct field access,
  array element access, and other GEP-heavy patterns

Status: in_progress
