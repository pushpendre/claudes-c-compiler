Task: Optimize IR with redundant cast elimination and extended simplification

Goal: Reduce generated code size and improve runtime performance by eliminating
redundant Cast instructions at the IR level. This benefits all three backends.

Key optimizations:
1. Cast chain elimination: Cast(Cast(x, A->B), B->C) patterns
   - Widen then narrow back: Cast(Cast(x, i32->i64), i64->i32) => x
   - Double narrow: Cast(Cast(x, i64->i32), i32->i16) => Cast(x, i64->i16)
   - Double widen: Cast(Cast(x, i16->i32), i32->i64) => Cast(x, i16->i64)
2. Same-size signed/unsigned casts as noop: Cast(x, I32->U32) => Copy
3. Extended simplify patterns in the simplify pass
4. Redundant comparison elimination

Baseline: zlib minigzip compression takes ~7.4s with CCC vs ~1.9s with GCC -O2
(3.9x gap). Goal is to measurably reduce this gap.
