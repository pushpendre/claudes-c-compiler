Improve peephole optimizer: eliminate redundant cltq past non-rax-clobbering instructions

Two changes:
1. Add Cltq as a producer for Cltq (back-to-back cltq;cltq elimination)
2. When a cltq consumer is found but the immediately preceding instruction is not
   a sign-extension producer, scan backward past instructions that don't write %rax
   to find the actual producer (e.g., cltq; mov %rax,%r8; cltq -> eliminate second cltq)

Status: in_progress
