Task: Add register-to-register copy propagation to x86 peephole optimizer

The CCC peephole optimizer handles store-to-stack/load-from-stack forwarding
(global_store_forwarding) but does NOT handle register-to-register copy
propagation. This means patterns like:

    movq %rax, %rcx         # copy rax to rcx
    movslq (%rcx), %rax     # use rcx as base address

are not optimized to:

    movslq (%rax), %rax     # use rax directly

This causes ~3x code bloat compared to GCC in hot DOOM rendering loops.

Plan: Add a new peephole pass that propagates register copies into
subsequent memory operands, eliminating intermediate register copies.
