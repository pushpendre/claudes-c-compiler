Task: Add peephole optimization to eliminate redundant register writeback patterns
Status: in_progress

Description:
The accumulator-centric codegen model generates patterns where a value in %rax
is saved to a callee-saved register, and then immediately loaded back to %rax:

    movq %rax, %rbx      ; save to callee-saved register
    movq %rbx, %rax      ; load back (REDUNDANT - %rax unchanged)

The second instruction is always redundant because %rax still has the value.

Analysis shows 878 occurrences in the Doom binary alone. This pattern appears
with all callee-saved registers (rbx, r12-r15) and caller-saved registers too.

The fix adds a peephole pattern to the combined_local_pass that detects adjacent
mov %regA, %regB followed by mov %regB, %regA and eliminates the second mov.

This also generalizes to any pair: mov %X, %Y followed by mov %Y, %X.

Expected impact: ~878 fewer instructions in Doom binary, improvement in
tight inner loops where this pattern appears frequently.
