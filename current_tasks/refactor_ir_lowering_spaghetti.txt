Task: Refactor IR lowering spaghetti code

The ir/lowering/expr.rs file contains a single 822-line lower_expr() function
that is the worst code quality issue in the project. Similarly, lower_local_decl()
in stmt.rs is 387 lines of deeply nested code.

Plan:
1. Break lower_expr() into focused helper functions:
   - lower_pointer_binop() - pointer arithmetic with scaling
   - lower_binop() - binary operation dispatch
   - lower_function_call() - function call dispatch (187 lines alone)
   - lower_compound_literal() - compound literal init
   - lower_cast_expr() - cast expression handling
   - lower_address_of() - address-of operator
   - lower_member_access() - struct member access
2. Break lower_local_decl() into helpers for initializer handling
3. Add subdirectory READMEs documenting the lowering architecture
4. Remove dead code and simplify where possible

Status: IN PROGRESS
