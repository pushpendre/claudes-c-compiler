Task: Refactor lowering code and remove dead code

Major cleanup of the ir/lowering module and related code:

1. Extract duplicated anonymous member init resolution into a shared helper
   (currently copy-pasted 5 times across stmt.rs, global_init_bytes.rs, global_init_compound.rs)

2. Extract duplicated struct field designator resolution into shared code

3. Remove dead code:
   - emit_bool_normalize (legacy, replaced by emit_bool_normalize_typed)
   - peel_ptr_from_return_type (trivial passthrough wrapper)
   - Duplicate lower_string_literal / lower_wide_string_literal

4. Consolidate similar small helper functions

5. Reduce deeply nested code in emit_struct_init (9+ levels)

6. Add/update README.md documentation in subdirectories
