Task: Refactor IR lowering stmt.rs and related duplication

Goals:
1. Deduplicate emit_struct_init() (532 lines) and lower_local_struct_init() (197 lines)
   which share nearly identical designated initializer walking logic
2. Break up the 537-line lower_stmt() monolith into per-statement-type methods
3. Deduplicate lower_complex_add/lower_complex_sub (identical except operator)
4. Merge lower_conditional/lower_gnu_conditional (near-identical functions)
5. General cleanup of expr.rs and complex.rs duplication

This is a refactoring-only task. No behavior changes.
