Task: Remove reward hacks (hardcoded cheating answers)

1. Fix __has_include() which always returns 1 - implement proper header existence checking
2. Fix assert() which is unconditionally a no-op - implement proper assert that respects NDEBUG

These are cases where the compiler returns hardcoded values to pass tests instead of implementing the feature correctly.
