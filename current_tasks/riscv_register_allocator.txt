RISC-V Register Allocator: Linear Scan with Callee-Saved Registers

Goal: Implement a register allocator for the RISC-V backend that assigns
frequently-used IR values to callee-saved registers (s1-s11) instead of
always spilling everything to the stack.

Approach:
1. Implement liveness analysis (live intervals for each IR value)
2. Implement linear scan register allocator using s1-s11 (11 callee-saved regs)
3. Add ValueLocation enum (Stack/Register) to backend state
4. Update RISC-V operand_to_t0 / store_t0_to to check ValueLocation
5. Save/restore used callee-saved registers in prologue/epilogue
6. Handle register pressure with spilling back to stack slots

This is the first backend to get a register allocator. x86 and ARM remain
stack-based. The architecture changes are designed to be backend-specific
so other backends are unaffected.

Key files:
- src/backend/state.rs (ValueLocation, allocator data structures)
- src/backend/riscv/codegen/codegen.rs (RISC-V-specific register allocation)
- src/backend/generation.rs (instruction dispatch, cache management)
