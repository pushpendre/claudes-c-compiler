Split all four assembler encoder.rs files into focused submodules.

The assembler encoder files are the largest in the codebase:
- x86/assembler/encoder.rs: 6229 lines
- arm/assembler/encoder.rs: 6164 lines
- i686/assembler/encoder.rs: 3475 lines
- riscv/assembler/encoder.rs: 2649 lines

Each will be split into submodules organized by instruction category
(e.g., gp_integer, sse/neon/vector, system, etc.) while keeping the
dispatch function in the main module.
