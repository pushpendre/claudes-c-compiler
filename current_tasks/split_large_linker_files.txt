Split the oversized linker files into smaller, well-organized modules.

Primary targets (all 2000+ lines):
1. riscv/linker/link.rs (3,849 lines) - 2 monolithic functions of 2319 and 1454 lines
2. arm/linker/mod.rs (3,355 lines) - several large functions
3. i686/linker/mod.rs (3,254 lines) - already partially split but main file still huge
4. x86/linker/mod.rs (3,064 lines) - several large functions
5. linker_common.rs (2,137 lines) - shared linker code

Approach:
- Extract ELF emission code into separate files (emit_exec.rs, emit_shared.rs)
- Extract helper functions (plt_got, gc_sections, symbol resolution)
- Decompose RISC-V's monolithic functions into smaller reusable pieces
- Split linker_common.rs into logical modules
- Add README.md files documenting the linker architecture
