Unify assembler numeric label resolution across all backends.

Currently numeric label resolution (1:, 1f, 1b) is duplicated 3 times:
- elf.rs (shared by x86/i686, operates on AsmItem, only lowercase f/b)
- arm/assembler/mod.rs (~200 lines, operates on AsmStatement, accepts F/B)
- riscv/assembler/elf_writer.rs (~130 lines, operates on AsmStatement, accepts F/B, no data directives)

Plan:
1. Create shared numeric_labels module in backend/ with trait-based generic resolution
2. Migrate ARM and RISC-V to use shared module
3. Fix case sensitivity inconsistency (x86/i686 only accept lowercase f/b)
4. Fix RISC-V to handle data directives (.long, .quad) with numeric refs
5. Remove duplicated code
