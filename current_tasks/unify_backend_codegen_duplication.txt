Unify duplicated code patterns across x86/ARM/RISC-V backend codegen files

The three backend codegen files (x86: 3862 lines, ARM: 3678 lines, RISC-V: 3909 lines)
contain significant code duplication. This task extracts shared patterns into the
trait system or shared helper functions.

Key patterns to unify:
1. Value resolution (alloca/register/stack slot dispatch) - ~53 occurrences across all 3
2. Switch jump table construction (table building + rodata emission)
3. Callee-save register save/restore loops in prologue/epilogue
4. Cast instruction dispatch (emit_cast_instrs structure)
5. Copy value logic (register-to-register, register-to-stack, etc.)
6. Call result store logic (emit_call_store_result)

Expected savings: ~600-900 lines of duplicated code removed.
Approach: Add default trait method implementations and shared helper functions.

Status: in_progress
