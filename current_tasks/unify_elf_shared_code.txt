Extract duplicated ELF code from all 4 assembler and linker backends into a shared module.

Currently every backend duplicates: ELF constants, StringTable, read/write helpers,
write_shdr, parse_archive_members, and parse_linker_script. This is ~1500 lines of
near-identical code across 8+ files.

Plan: Create src/backend/elf.rs with shared code, update all backends to use it.
