Unify the duplicated struct-field-traversal logic in global initialization.

Three separate functions implement the same struct field walking algorithm for
different output targets. This refactoring introduces an InitEmitter trait with
ByteEmitter, CompoundEmitter, and HybridEmitter implementations, and a single
walk_struct_init() function that replaces all five duplicated traversal loops.
