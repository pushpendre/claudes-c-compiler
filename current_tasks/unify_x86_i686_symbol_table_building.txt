Migrate x86 and i686 assemblers to use shared build_elf_symbol_table().

Currently ARM and RISC-V assemblers use the shared build_elf_symbol_table()
function from elf.rs, but x86 and i686 still manually build their symbol
tables with ~130+ lines of ad-hoc code each. This is the most important
cohesion discrepancy between the assemblers.

This task refactors both x86 and i686 to:
1. Convert their internal label_positions (section index-based) to the
   (section_name, offset) format that SymbolTableInput expects
2. Convert their pending_* fields to the HashMap format build_elf_symbol_table expects
3. Replace the manual symbol table construction with a call to build_elf_symbol_table
4. Keep COMMON symbols as extra_symbols (same pattern as ARM/RISC-V)

Status: in_progress
