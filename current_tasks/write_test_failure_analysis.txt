Task: Write comprehensive test failure analysis files for all three architectures
Status: In Progress
Date: 2026-01-25

Goal: Run the full test suite on x86, ARM, and RISC-V, categorize all failures,
and write ideas/fix_remaining_{x86,arm,riscv}_tests.txt with actionable analysis.

Additionally, identify and fix one category of failures (likely __label__ local labels
support, which causes compile errors across all 3 architectures).
