Task: x86 assembler short jump relaxation

The built-in x86 assembler (MY_ASM=builtin) currently always emits 6-byte near
conditional jumps (0F 8x + disp32) and 5-byte unconditional jumps (E9 + disp32),
even when the target is a local label that fits in a short 2-byte encoding
(7x + disp8 for Jcc, EB + disp8 for JMP).

This causes byte-level mismatches vs GCC's assembler output.

Fix: implement a relaxation pass in the ELF object builder that converts long
jumps to short jumps when the displacement fits in a signed byte.
