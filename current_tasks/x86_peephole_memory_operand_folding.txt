Task: Add x86 peephole pass for memory operand folding
Status: in_progress
Started: 2026-01-30

Description:
Add a peephole optimization pass that folds stack load + ALU instruction patterns
into single instructions with memory source operands. This is a key x86 optimization
that reduces instruction count and register pressure.

Patterns to fold:
1. movq -N(%rbp), %rax; addq %rax, %reg -> addq -N(%rbp), %reg
2. movq -N(%rbp), %rcx; addq %rcx, %rax -> addq -N(%rbp), %rax
3. Same for subq, andq, orq, xorq, cmpq (commutative and non-commutative ops)
4. Similar patterns with 32-bit variants (movl, addl, etc.)

Expected impact: Significant reduction in instruction count for spill-heavy code.
On Doom binary, this targets thousands of load+use patterns.
