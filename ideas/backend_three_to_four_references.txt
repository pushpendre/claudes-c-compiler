Fix "three backends" references throughout codebase
====================================================
Priority: LOW

The i686 backend was added but many source code comments and doc comments
still say "all three backends" or "3 backends". These should be updated
to say "all four backends" or "4 backends".

Affected files (non-exhaustive):
- src/backend/cast.rs
- src/backend/state.rs
- src/backend/common.rs
- src/backend/inline_asm.rs
- Various comments throughout src/backend/

This is cosmetic but confusing for newcomers.
