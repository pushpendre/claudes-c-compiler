Fix kernel build regression: GEN_BINARY_RMWcc / init_on_free macro expansion

Both x86 and RISC-V kernel builds fail on HEAD (post-commit db5607c8).

x86 error: GEN_BINARY_RMWcc_5 implicit declaration in arch/x86/include/asm/bitops.h
RISC-V error: init_on_free undeclared in include/linux/mm.h

These are macro expansion / preprocessor issues that appeared after the sema
anonymous struct counter fix (db5607c8). The kernel built and booted
successfully at commit b784ad5f.

This is a CRITICAL regression since kernel compilation is a key test case.
The issue may be in the preprocessor's handling of complex macro expansions
involving token pasting, stringification, or nested macro calls.

Priority: HIGH - blocks kernel CI.
