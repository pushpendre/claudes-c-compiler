Fix postgres catcache lookup failure on RISC-V and ARM
======================================================

Problem:
  PostgreSQL builds and initdb succeeds on RISC-V and ARM, but "make check"
  fails because postgres reports "cache lookup failed for database 5" when
  connecting to the 'postgres' database. Connecting to 'template1' works fine.

  In single-user mode, querying pg_database shows all 3 databases (template1,
  template0, postgres) with correct OIDs. The pg_database heap file is byte-
  identical to the x86 version.

Key observations:
  1. x86 postgres works fine (215/216 tests pass)
  2. RISC-V/ARM build succeeds (after fixing -static vs -shared linker issue)
  3. initdb creates correct catalog data (byte-identical to x86)
  4. Single-user mode can query pg_database and find all databases
  5. Multi-user mode connecting to template1 works
  6. Multi-user mode connecting to postgres fails: "cache lookup failed for database 5"
  7. The error is in CheckMyDatabase() -> SearchSysCache1(DATABASEOID, ObjectIdGetDatum(5))
  8. Basic OID hashing and comparison tests pass on RISC-V

Analysis:
  The catcache (system cache) lookup for OID 5 fails despite the data being
  present in the heap. The catcache is a hash table that lazily loads tuples
  from the underlying catalog tables. Since template1 (OID 1) works, the
  catcache mechanism is fundamentally functional. The issue is specific to
  looking up OID 5 in the pg_database catalog cache.

  Possible causes:
  - Codegen bug in catcache hash bucket computation or comparison
  - Index scan bug (pg_database has a unique index on OID)
  - Memory alignment issue in hash table operations on RISC-V/ARM
  - Struct padding difference affecting HeapTuple access

Debugging approach:
  1. Compile specific postgres files with GCC and our compiler, swap them
     one at a time to isolate which source file contains the miscompilation
  2. Focus on: catcache.c, dynahash.c, hashfunc.c, postinit.c, heapam.c
  3. Use -g flag to enable debug info, then use gdb/qemu-riscv64 -g to
     set breakpoints in SearchSysCache1 and trace the lookup
  4. Compare assembly output of the catcache lookup functions between GCC
     and our compiler
