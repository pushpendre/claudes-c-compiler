Fix remaining i686 project failures
=====================================
Date: 2026-01-28 (updated after inline asm typed register load fix)

Current status:
- Unit tests: ~99.7% pass (10% sample: 2728/2737)
- Projects passing: 5/12 (zlib, lua, libpng, jq, libuv)
- Projects failing: libsodium, mquickjs, libjpeg, mbedtls, libffi, musl, tcc

Fixed in latest round (inline asm typed register load fix):
- libsodium now BUILDS (was failing with "operand size mismatch for `movzw'")
- The issue was movzwl/movsbl/movswl used 16/8-bit dest registers in inline asm
- Runtime tests still fail (segfaults and timeouts in crypto operations)

Known remaining issues:

1. mquickjs: SIGSEGV in js_string_compare during JS parsing
   - Crashes in get_string_ptr -> JS_VALUE_TO_PTR returning garbage pointer
   - JSValue is uint32_t on i686, pointer tagged with low bits
   - val=0x236 -> ptr = val-1 = 0x235, which is not a heap pointer
   - Root cause: likely corruption during JSValueArray access or value passing
   - Needs deep debugging to find where the corruption occurs

2. sqlite: SIGSEGV in columnTypeImpl (0/622 tests pass)
   - Crashes dereferencing NULL struct pointer + offset 0x1c
   - Pattern: pTab=NULL, then pTab->field crashes
   - May share root cause with mquickjs (struct/pointer codegen issue)

3. musl: 3/6 tests pass (hello, string_ops, math pass)
   - malloc test: malloc returns NULL despite brk() succeeding
   - io test: tmpfile() fails (likely related to mmap)
   - environ test: setenv/getenv broken (returns "fail")
   - Built musl has __udivdi3/__umoddi3 deps (satisfied by -lgcc)

4. libsodium: Build succeeds, 0/7 tests pass
   - sodium_init() hangs/segfaults in some tests
   - Random test crashes immediately (SIGSEGV)

5. libjpeg: 1/2 tests pass (roundtrip passes, jpegtran fails)
   - Error: "Bogus virtual array access" from libjpeg-turbo runtime
   - Suggests incorrect array indexing or struct field access

6. mbedtls: Build fails (__builtin_ia32_pshufd not implemented)
   - Needs SSE2 intrinsic: _mm_shuffle_epi32 -> __builtin_ia32_pshufd
   - Used in AES-NI key schedule (aesni_set_rk_128/192/256)

7. libffi: Build succeeds, 0/6 tests pass (all SIGSEGV)
   - All FFI call tests crash
   - Likely i686 ABI/calling convention issue in libffi's closure/trampoline code

8. tcc: Build fails in lib/alloca86_64.S
   - TCC tries to build x86-64 runtime support even when built for i686
   - Not a compiler bug - TCC Makefile configuration issue

Unit test failure categories:
- Complex number tests (SIGSEGV) - fix_complex_comparison_i64_type being worked on
- Stack alignment >8 bytes: _Alignas(16+) not working for stack vars on i686
- Integer constant overflow: large UL constants not promoted to ULL on ILP32

Priority investigation targets:
- mquickjs/sqlite crashes likely share a common codegen root cause
- Stack _Alignas(>=16) support for i686
- musl malloc failure (mmap-related?)

Techniques:
- Compare i686 assembly output against i686-linux-gnu-gcc for suspect functions
- Use GDB to trace execution and find divergence points
- strace to check syscall behavior for musl failures
