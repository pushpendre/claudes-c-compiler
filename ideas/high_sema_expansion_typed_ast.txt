HIGH PRIORITY: Expand sema to produce a typed AST, reducing lowering responsibilities

Current state (after TypeContext move to sema/type_context.rs):
The sema pass collects type information (typedefs, struct layouts, enum constants,
function signatures) but does NOT:
- Type-check expressions
- Infer expression types
- Reject type errors
- Produce a typed AST

The lowerer (ir/lowering/) is ~20K lines and handles both type inference AND IR
emission. Key type-inference code that should move to sema:

1. Expression type inference (expr_types.rs, 1286 lines)
   - get_expr_type(): determines IrType of any expression
   - expr_ctype(): determines CType of any expression
   - struct_value_size(): checks if expression produces struct value
   These are pure type queries with no IR emission.

2. Constant expression evaluation (const_eval.rs, 969 lines)
   Both sema and lowering have const_eval. Sema's is simpler (for enum values,
   array dimensions). Lowering's handles more cases (global initializers,
   sizeof of complex types). These should be unified.

3. Type conversion duplication (DONE - unified via TypeConvertContext trait)
   The type_spec_to_ctype dispatch was unified into type_builder.rs.

4. Declaration analysis (lowering.rs analyze_declaration, ~200 lines)
   Computes DeclAnalysis from type specifiers. This is type analysis, not IR.

Incremental approach:
Step 1: (DONE) Move TypeContext to sema/type_context.rs
Step 2: Move expr_ctype() to sema (expression CType inference without IR)
Step 3: Add type annotations to AST nodes (or build typed AST wrapper)
Step 4: Move constant evaluation to sema
Step 5: Add actual type error diagnostics in sema
Step 6: Simplify lowering to assume types are correct

Benefits:
- Type errors become diagnostics instead of IR lowering panics
- Lowering shrinks from ~20K to ~12K lines
- Clearer module boundary: sema validates, lowering emits
- Enables future type-system features (generics, better error messages)
