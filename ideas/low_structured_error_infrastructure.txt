LOW PRIORITY: Structured error infrastructure follow-ups

COMPLETED (2026-01-28):
- Created DiagnosticEngine in common/error.rs with Diagnostic, Severity, source snippets
- Wired into parser: all 4 eprintln! error sites replaced with emit_error()
- Wired into sema: errors and warnings go through DiagnosticEngine
- Wired into preprocessor: #warning collected as warnings (not bare eprintln!)
- Driver threads DiagnosticEngine through parser -> sema pipeline
- Source snippet rendering with caret/underline using SourceManager::get_source_line()
- GCC-compatible output format: "file:line:col: error: message"

COMPLETED (2026-01-28):
- Added WarningKind enum with categorized warnings (Undeclared, ImplicitFunctionDeclaration, Cpp)
- Added WarningConfig for per-warning enable/disable and error promotion
- Implemented -Werror (global), -Werror=<name>, -Wno-error=<name> for selective promotion
- Implemented -Wall, -Wextra, -W<name>, -Wno-<name> for warning control
- Left-to-right flag processing matching GCC semantics
- GCC-style [-W<name>] and [-Werror=<name>] suffixes on diagnostic messages
- Updated sema and preprocessor warning sites with WarningKind tags
- Wired WarningConfig from CLI through Driver to DiagnosticEngine

REMAINING FOLLOW-UPS:
1. Add spans to sema errors/warnings (currently use error_no_span/warning_no_span)
2. Add spans to preprocessor errors (#error directives)
3. Wire DiagnosticEngine into IR lowering phase (standalone eprintln! with no buffering)
4. Add more WarningKind categories as compiler implements more warnings
   (UnusedVariable, ReturnType, SignCompare, ImplicitConversion, etc.)
5. Remove the legacy `errors: Vec<String>` from sema (currently kept for backward compat)
6. Consider adding "note:" follow-up messages for context (e.g., "previous declaration was here")

Key files:
- src/common/error.rs (DiagnosticEngine, Diagnostic, Severity)
- src/common/source.rs (SourceManager with line map, get_source_line for snippets)
- src/frontend/parser/parser.rs (uses emit_error/emit_warning)
- src/frontend/sema/sema.rs (uses diagnostics.error_no_span/warning_no_span)
- src/frontend/preprocessor/preprocessor.rs (collects errors and warnings Vecs)
- src/driver/driver.rs (creates and threads DiagnosticEngine through phases)
