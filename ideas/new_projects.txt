Project Testing Status Tracker
===============================
Format: [project] - ARM: pass/fail, x86: pass/fail, riscv: pass/fail, i686: pass/fail. Notes: any notes

zlib - ARM: pass, x86: pass, riscv: pass, i686: pass. Notes: core compression library
lua - ARM: pass, x86: pass, riscv: pass, i686: pass. Notes: scripting language
libsodium - ARM: pass, x86: pass, riscv: pass, i686: pass. Notes: crypto library
mquickjs - ARM: pass, x86: pass, riscv: pass, i686: pass. Notes: JS engine, i686 now passing
libpng - ARM: pass, x86: pass, riscv: pass, i686: pass. Notes: PNG library
jq - ARM: pass, x86: pass, riscv: pass, i686: pass. Notes: JSON processor
libjpeg - ARM: pass, x86: pass, riscv: pass, i686: pass. Notes: JPEG library
mbedtls - ARM: pass, x86: pass, riscv: pass, i686: pass. Notes: TLS library
libuv - ARM: pass, x86: pass, riscv: pass, i686: pass. Notes: async I/O
libffi - ARM: pass, x86: pass, riscv: pass, i686: pass. Notes: riscv now passing
musl - ARM: pass, x86: pass, riscv: pass, i686: pass. Notes: i686 now passing
tcc - ARM: pass, x86: pass, riscv: pass, i686: pass. Notes: tiny C compiler
fastlz - ARM: pass, x86: pass, riscv: pass, i686: pass. Notes: FIXED i686 - was failing due to F64 skip-slot bug
mruby - ARM: pass, x86: pass, riscv: pass, i686: pass. Notes: FIXED - build scripts rewrote to not need ruby/rake
spng - ARM: pass, x86: pass, riscv: pass, i686: pass. Notes: PNG library
mupdf - ARM: pass, x86: pass, riscv: pass, i686: pass. Notes: FIXED - preprocessor #include inside multi-line expression
squashfuse - ARM: pass, x86: pass, riscv: pass, i686: pass. Notes: FIXED - was failing due to linker arg ordering
SWI-Prolog - ARM: fail, x86: fail, riscv: fail, i686: fail. Notes: x86 compiles but crashes at boot (runtime codegen bug), needs GMP=OFF. Fixed preprocessor chained macros, TLS PIC model, and static init address-of bugs.
exim - ARM: untested, x86: untested, riscv: untested, i686: pass. Notes: requires db.h stub + libdb stub for i386. Fixed symlink include resolution bug. Build scripts need modification for missing libdb-dev/libpcre2-dev packages.
MicroPython - ARM: pass, x86: pass, riscv: pass, i686: n/a. Notes: required C99 inline linkage (weak), -ffunction-sections, __attribute__((naked))/optimize("omit-frame-pointer"), volatile pointer qualifier fix, FAM pointer init fix
lemon - ARM: pass, x86: pass, riscv: pass, i686: pass. Notes: FIXED - func ptr deref with pointer return type was incorrectly classified as pointer-to-function-pointer
Gravity - ARM: pass, x86: pass, riscv: pass, i686: pass. Notes: FIXED - ternary struct address normalization: `ptr ? *ptr : (struct){...}` both branches produce addresses (not just compound literals), use expr_produces_packed_struct_data() with struct-type guard
mpack - ARM: untested, x86: fail, riscv: untested, i686: untested. Notes: C99 inline no-emit fix resolved fn_mpack_tag_nil address comparison; remaining failure in test_write_generic_kv (likely separate codegen bug)
yyjson - ARM: pass, x86: pass, riscv: pass, i686: pass. Notes: FIXED - scalar init of struct member (.ptr = 3 where ptr is a struct) was dropping the value; first member of inner struct was not being set
ffmpeg - ARM: untested, x86: pass, riscv: untested, i686: untested. Notes: builds and runs with --disable-x86asm. FATE test suite: all tests pass except sws-unscaled (also fails with gcc). ffmpeg/ffprobe binaries produce correct output for video/audio encoding/decoding.
Janet - ARM: pass, x86: pass, riscv: pass, i686: fail. Notes: FIXED x86/arm/riscv - TLS global addr folding was bypassing %fs:/@TPOFF access for initialized thread-local statics, causing segfault in janet_collect. i686 has separate boot test failure (format-related).
http-parser - ARM: untested, x86: pass, riscv: untested, i686: untested. Notes: was listed as failing but x86 passes now.
