QEMU Build Support Status
=========================

Summary: QEMU 10.2.50 can be compiled (1700+ C files) and linked using ccc-x86
without any gcc wrapper workarounds. --version, -cpu help, and basic VM startup
work correctly. Must use --enable-slirp for user networking support.
Serial output from guest (kernel boot console) is not displayed - likely
a miscompilation in the chardev/serial I/O path.

Build Status:
- Configure: PASS
- Compilation: PASS (all files including qapi-introspect.c compile natively)
- Linking: PASS
- Runtime: PARTIAL - "--version", "-cpu help", and VM startup work (no crash),
  but serial console output from the guest is missing (no output on -nographic)

Build Steps:
  1. Copy QEMU source to writable location (cp -r /deps/qemu /tmp/qemu_build)
  2. Configure out-of-tree:
     cd /tmp/qemu_build && mkdir build && cd build
     ../configure --cc=/path/to/ccc-x86
       --target-list=x86_64-softmmu --disable-docs --disable-gtk --disable-sdl
       --disable-opengl --disable-virglrenderer --disable-spice --disable-vte
       --disable-curses
  3. Build: ninja -j$(nproc) qemu-system-x86_64
  Note: `make -j128` builds all targets including test libraries. One test file
  (virtio-9p-client.c) fails due to __attribute__((common, weak)) interaction
  with the assembler. Use `ninja qemu-system-x86_64` to build just the emulator.

Known Issues Fixed:
  1. __has_attribute macro aliasing (cleanup attribute) - FIXED
  2. Bitfield ICE in global_init_compound_struct - FIXED
  3. Response file (@file) support - FIXED
  4. Compound literal array init (CPU double-registration) - FIXED
  5. Bool pointer array init (migration crash) - FIXED
  6. Preprocessor MAX_PENDING_NEWLINES too low for qapi-introspect.c - FIXED
     The preprocessor's line accumulation limit for multi-line macro invocations
     was 2000 lines, but QEMU's QLIT_QLIST() macro spans ~32000 lines.
     Increased to 100,000.
  7. _Generic selection in global/static initializer arrays - FIXED
     QEMU's OUTOP macro uses _Generic in designated initializers:
       [INDEX_op_st32] = _Generic(outop_st, TCGOutOpStore: &outop_st.base)
     The all_outop[] array was zero-initialized because _Generic was not
     resolved in eval_const_expr, eval_global_addr_expr, array_needs_compound_init,
     or collect_compound_init_element. This caused SIGILL in opcode_args_ct()
     when tcg_target_op_def returned C_NotImplemented for basic TCG opcodes.

Remaining Issues:
  1. Test library virtio-9p-client.c: __attribute__((common, weak)) on
     global_qtest causes assembler error "symbol can not be both weak and common".
     Not blocking - only affects test targets, not the main emulator binary.
  2. Serial console output not reaching chardev backend:
     When running with -nographic or -serial file:..., the guest kernel's
     serial output (console=ttyS0) is never written to the output fd.
     The QEMU main loop polls normally and the VM runs, but no serial data
     appears. The chardev/serial emulation path may have another
     miscompilation - strace shows only eventfd writes, no file writes.
     Note: Must use --enable-slirp during configure for -net user support
     (slirp is a meson subproject, not available via system pkg-config).

Priority: HIGH - Serial output is the remaining blocker for running a
Linux kernel with DOOM in the compiled QEMU. The VM starts and doesn't
crash, but without serial output there's no way to interact with the guest.
